Yemen Comprehensive Analysis (2015–Nov 2025)

Current date: 11 Nov 2025 (Africa/Cairo)
Scope: This report compiles major events, analyses and reports on Yemen from credible sources (Sana’a Center for Strategic Studies, Brookings Institution, NRC, Barran Press, Reuters, United Nations and other think‑tanks) to provide a concise yet comprehensive knowledge base on Yemen’s political, economic, social and security environment between 2015 and November 2025.

1. Historical background (pre‑2015 context)

Yemen’s modern history has been turbulent. After the republican forces overthrew the imamate in north Yemen in 1962, the country remained divided: the Yemen Arab Republic (north) and the Marxist Popular Democratic Republic of Yemen (south). They unified in 1990, but the union was troubled and widely perceived in the south as a takeover by the north.
Yemen’s Zaydi Shia community (35–40 % of the population) felt economically and politically marginalised in the new republic. The Houthi family channelled this discontent into six rounds of fighting between 2004‑2010.
During the Arab Spring, widespread protests forced President Ali Abdullah Saleh to cede power to his vice‑president, Abdrabbu Mansour Hadi, in November 2011. A UN‑brokered national dialogue (2012‑2013) failed, and the Houthis—supported by Saleh loyalists—seized Sana’a in 2014.

Yemen: Comprehensive Knowledge Base (2015–Present)

Introduction: Since the 2014–2015 outbreak of civil war, Yemen’s political and economic landscape has been dominated by fragmentation between a Houthi-controlled north, an internationally-recognized government (IRG) in the south, and active regional actors. This report synthesizes Sana’a Center and other high‑quality analyses (2015–2025) on Yemen’s governance, stakeholders, economy, society, conflict dynamics, foreign involvement, infrastructure, and humanitarian conditions.  Each section is heavily cited and organized thematically and chronologically, with tables of key events, stakeholders, and economic/city indicators.

1. Political History and Governance

Yemen’s modern polity began with unification of North and South in 1990 under Ali Abdullah Saleh’s General People’s Congress (GPC) party.  Early post-unification politics were dominated by the GPC, the southern Yemeni Socialist Party (YSP) and the Islamist Islah party .  In 1994 civil war Saleh’s GPC allied with Saudi-backed forces crushed the south, consolidating north‑dominated rule .  Saleh’s government permitted 22 parties by 1993, but used state resources to marginalize rivals.  Islah and GPC then ousted the YSP from power structures, fueling southern secessionist sentiment .

Following Yemen’s 2011 Arab Spring protests, Saleh resigned (2012) under a Gulf‑brokered transition; Vice President Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi became president.  Hadi’s IRG oversaw a National Dialogue and drafted a federal constitution (2014), but its proposals angered the Houthi movement and many in the south .  In late 2014 Houthis (Ansar Allah) took over Sana’a and northern provinces, sidelining Hadi’s administration.  Under duress Hadi briefly resigned (Jan 2015) but renounced it after fleeing to Aden and then to Riyadh .  On 26–27 March 2015, a Saudi‑led Arab coalition (UAE, etc.) launched “Operation Decisive Storm” to restore Hadi’s government .

Governance structures:  Yemen now has two competing centers of power.  In Sana’a (north), the Houthis (supported by ex-GPC elements) have established parallel institutions – a Supreme Political Council and de facto ministries – sidelining pre‑war state bodies.  In Aden/South, Hadi (and since 2022 a Saudi‑backed Presidential Leadership Council, PLC) claims legitimacy; IRG ministries and military units (supported by the Saudi/UAE coalition and southern forces) operate mainly in Aden, Hadramawt, Shabwa and parts of Marib  .  Local councils, once a key part of decentralized governance, have mostly collapsed financially but remain the primary service providers.  Sana’a Center analysis finds that local councils “continue to operate in some form in most parts of the country” but lack resources and face militia interference .  Houthi authorities in the north have increasingly replaced elected councils with loyalists, while in the south councils are split between IRG, Emirati-trained forces, and Southern Transitional Council (STC) proxies.

Political parties and movements: Traditional parties have been largely eclipsed.  Before 2011, the GPC (Saleh’s party) dominated state institutions; after 2011 it split between Hadi‑aligned and Saleh/Houthi‑aligned factions .  Islah (a Sunni Islamist party) remained Hadi’s main ally .  The STC – a UAE‑backed separatist group formed in 2017 – has become a major political force in the south, espousing secession and commanding its own armed units.  Yemeni Socialists and other leftists hold little sway in the north today.  Sana’a Center notes that during the war “new political movements grew more powerful than traditional parties,” with the Houthis and STC imposing authority in areas they control .

Governance reforms: The 2000 Local Governance Law had envisaged elected councils at district/governorate levels , but elections after 2006 were repeatedly postponed; councils elected in 2006 (7,032 members nationally) remain in place.  Decentralization has never been fully realized; the Sana’a Center warns that without local input, any peace will founder.  Notably, the Houthis and Saleh earlier sought political accommodation through a “Peace and National Partnership Agreement” (Mar 2015) that would have formed a transitional presidency.  That deal fell apart as the Houthis consolidated power  .

Federalism and North/South divide: Proposals for a federal or semi‑federal Yemen have long existed (e.g. 2014 National Dialogue).  Resentment in the south is strong, given decades of perceived marginalization.  In 2020 Saudi- and UAE- backed negotiations produced a Riyadh Agreement (Nov 2019) to share power between Hadi’s government and the STC; but implementation stalled .  Separatists remain influential in Aden and Lahj, often clashing with Islah‑aligned or Saudi‑backed northern forces.

2. Conflict Dynamics and Chronology

Yemen’s war has ebbed and flowed with periodic ceasefires and shifting fronts. The timeline below (table) highlights major conflict-related events, peace efforts and international interventions (2014–2023).  Key references are provided for context.

Date	Event
2014 September	Houthis (with Saleh loyalists) seize Sana’a, marginalizing Hadi’s government .
2015 Jan 22	Houthi gunmen surround presidential palace; PM Khaled Bahah resigns; Hadi announces resignation (later rescinded) .
2015 Feb 15	Houthi forces arrest President Hadi; he escapes house arrest in late Feb .
2015 Mar 26	Saudi‑led coalition launches Operation Decisive Storm to restore Hadi; Hadi flees Aden to Riyadh .
2015 Apr–Dec	Coalition air campaign and blockade causes severe humanitarian crisis. Houthi fronts stabilized.

2023 Oct 19	Houthi forces begin missile/drone attacks on Red Sea shipping (escalating Red Sea “maritime war”; global response).

Additional ceasefire/peace efforts have been attempted: UN envoys’ proposals (e.g. Griffiths’s 2019 nationwide ceasefire plan, 2020 Washington talks) have all failed .  As of 2025, frontline lines remain largely frozen: the Houthis hold Sana’a, the northwest (Sa’ada, Hajjah, parts of Taiz), while IRG/SELC forces hold southern and eastern provinces (Hadramawt, parts of Abyan, Shabwa, most of Marib until late 2021, Aden, Lahj).  Sporadic clashes continue (e.g. Marib in 2021–22).

3. Key Stakeholders

Yemen’s conflict involves a complex web of internal and external actors. The table below summarizes major stakeholders (parties, leaders, foreign actors) with their roles, regions and alignments:

Name/Entity	Role/Title	Region/Affiliation	Stance/Alignment
Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi	President (2012–2022), now PLC head	South (Aden/Marib); IRG	Pro-unity; backed by Saudi-led coalition. Captured by Houthis Jan 2015; fled to Riyadh .
Ansar Allah (Houthis)	Shiite militia & ruling authority	North (Sana’a, Sa’ada, Hajjah, parts of Taiz)	Anti-Hadi; allied with former GPC; allied with Iran. Controls Sana’a govt; Islamic-conservative.
Mohammed Ali al-Houthi	Houthi leader (Supreme Political Council)	Sana’a (Northwest)	Supreme de facto leader since 2015; antagonistic to IRG; close to Iran .
Southern Transitional Council (STC)	Political movement (separatist)	South (Aden, Abyan, Lahj, Socotra)	Seeks southern autonomy/secession; UAE-backed. Led by Aiderous al-Zubaidi (former Aden gov) since 2017. Aligns with UAE proxies in south .
UAE (MBZ)	Coalition partner, Emirati Crown Prince	UAE/Southern Yemen	Initially coalition co-leader; supports southern proxies (STC, Giants, Hadrami forces) . Drew down combat forces in 2019.
Saudi Arabia (MBS)	Coalition leader, Saudi Crown Prince	Saudi Arabia/Northern Yemen	Coalition leader backing IRG; seeks weak, friendly Yemen. Intervened militarily (2015), imposes blockades . Conducts talks with Houthis (2023–2024).
Iran (Rouhani/Khamenei)	Regional patron (Islamic Republic)	Iran/Houthis	Supports Houthis (arms, training); denies direct control. 2020: Iran sent Houthi ambassador to Sana’a, effectively recognizing them .
USA (Biden administration)	Major power/donor	Western/IRG	Logistical/intel support for coalition; main terror-strike power (drone war vs AQAP) . Ended mid-2021 offensive support; revoked Houthi terror label (Feb 2021) . Recently pressuring Gulf states for ceasefire.
United Nations (UN)	Intergovernmental mediator	UN Special Envoy (Griffiths→Grundberg)	Calls for ceasefires; brokered Stockholm (2018), Oman talks (2016), Riyadh talks (2020). Issues sanctions (UNSCR 2216) primarily against Houthis.
Al-Qaeda in Arabian Peninsula (AQAP)	Jihadist militant group	South (Abyan, Bayda) and weak presence in Marib	Enemy of both Houthis and IRG. Defeated in Mukalla (2016) by UAE-backed forces , but resurged in parts of Abyan/Marib. Covertly aligns at times with local factions.
Islamic State (IS-Yemen)	Militant group	Primarily in Abyan, occasional elsewhere	Active 2015–present; conducts occasional attacks (e.g. mosque bombings in Sana’a, 2015). Opposed by Houthis and AQAP.
The Southern Movement (“Hirak”)	Grassroots separatist movement	South (Aden, Lahj, Abyan)	Diverse southerners opposing northern domination. Some elements joined STC; others allied with Hadi government. Key figure: Aidarus al-Zubaidi (STC leader).
Former President Saleh (GPC) (†Dec 2017)	Longtime strongman	Sanaa (North)	Initially Hadi ally, split to support Houthis (2014). 2017: attempted switch; killed by Houthis. Saleh’s GPC faction has since fragmented .
Local Tribes (e.g. Hashid, Bakil)	Tribal confederations, elders	Nationwide (North/South)	Varied stances: e.g. Hashid leaders allied with Saleh, others with coalition. Some tribes in Hadramawt/Abyan have resisted Saudi/UAE incursions or Houthi advances.
Oman (Sultanate)	Neutral mediator	Oman (east border with Yemen)	Did not join coalition; hosts Houthi talks; facilitated prisoner negotiations . Supports dialogue; concerned over SMR missile smuggling.
Qatar (2015–17,2021)	Gulf state (former coalition member)	Qatar/Qatari in Yemen	Left coalition in 2017; provided clandestine support (via Oman) to some anti-Hadi forces (e.g. Taiz). Restored Gulf relations in 2021.
UK & Western Partners	Aid donors, arms suppliers	UK/International	UK supports Saudi-led coalition diplomatically and via arms sales . Provides UN aid. UN & NGOs deliver humanitarian assistance.
UN Agencies & NGOs	Humanitarian relief, development	Nationwide	UN (OCHA, WFP, WHO, etc.) and NGOs run vast aid programs. Humanitarian efforts are hampered by funding shortfalls and access issues (esp. Houthi restrictions) .

4. Economic Conditions

Yemen’s economy has collapsed under war and blockade. Pre-war, Yemen was oil-dependent (modest production ~130,000 bpd) and relied on remittances and foreign aid.  Since 2015, conflict has destroyed much infrastructure and disrupted finance .  GDP fell precipitously (World Bank estimates a loss of ~$126 billion 2015–20 ), poverty rose (>74% in 2024 ), and per-capita incomes shrank ~70% since 2014 .

Currency and Central Banking:  Crucially, Yemen now has two competing central banks and riyals.  The internationally-recognized Central Bank of Yemen–Aden (CBY‑Aden) prints new notes to finance southern government budgets, while the Houthi‑controlled CBY‑Sana’a in 2020 banned these “new rials,” effectively splitting the currency .  This dual currency system drives inflation. By early 2022 the southern rial was ~YR1,260=US$1 (vs ~YR580 in 2014) .  In 2024–25, CBY‑Aden introduced exchange controls and import financing (the “UNMONEY” network) to stabilize the rial, causing it to appreciate over 40% by mid-2025 .  CBY‑Sana’a countered by banning Houthi-area banks from the new system .  In Sept 2025 the rial leveled at ~1,630/YR per US$1; but large redemptions and resumed Saudi aid have bolstered it, lowering food prices  . Houthi areas, however, maintained a fixed exchange rate, so their official prices fell little.

Revenue and finance: War has cut off hydrocarbon exports (declining oil & gas production). Houthi missile attacks on southern oil terminals in 2022–23 halved government oil revenues . Customs and tax revenues are contested: the Houthis now tax imports at Hudaydah and other ports, while the south relies on Aid from Gulf states. CBY‑Aden is nearly bankrupt: salaries and army pay have been unpaid since mid‑2025 . The government (now PLC) has no formal budget since 2019  and depends on Saudi grants ($1–2 billion in irregular installments). World Bank, IMF and Arab funds have provided limited support.

Inflation and prices: Food and fuel prices skyrocketed early in the war (up to 400–700% inflation).  By mid-2025, easing of the currency crisis in the south halved basic food prices (a 34% MoM drop in minimum food basket price) ; however, Houthi areas saw minimal change (Houthi-fixed rates) .  Fuel subsidies ended in Hadi areas; official petrol in Aden fell 22–28% in Aug 2025 . By contrast, in Houthi territories fuel remains at official rates (lower than black-market).  Socotra island saw fuel and gas prices soar (~20x normal) due to an Emirati-controlled monopoly, causing local protests .

Economic sectors: Yemen’s economy is largely informal. Agriculture and qat (a mild stimulant) employ two-thirds of Yemenis. Industry (oil refining, aluminum, cement) has mostly shut. Remittances from abroad are vital (pre-war 10–20% of GDP). In Houthi areas, unchecked money-printing spurred hyperinflation by 2022 . In IRG areas, imports dried up until Oman‑brokered humanitarian flights resumed oil for the Aden refinery (2015 crisis).

Economic indicators: The table below summarizes key macro indicators (latest estimates) and conditions in major cities:

Indicator/City	Value / Control	Notes & Trends (2025)
GDP (nominal)	~$30–40 billion (pre-war: ~$60–75 B)	Estimated halving of GDP since 2015 ; service sector collapsed.
Inflation	~40% (southern rial based)	High but falling with rial support; north sees lower official prices, high black-market rates .
Exchange Rate	~1,630 YR per USD (Government area)	Rial stabilized by CBY-Aden reforms ; Houthi areas use older notes, similar par value.
Currency	Yemeni riyal (split CBY-Aden/CBY-Sana’a)	Houthi notes vs new Aden notes; no unified currency policy .
Poverty	~74% (2022 est.)	Among highest globally. 62–64% of households food-insecure (Aug 2025) .
IDPs/Refugees	4.56 million IDPs (internal, 2023)	Concentrated in Marib, Sana’a, Aden areas; millions in need of aid.
Humanitarian need	18+ million (as of 2024)	Nearly 60% malnourished (2022) ; WFP cycle aid ongoing in north/south .
Sana’a	Houthi-controlled; pop ~3.9m (urban)	Capital (official). Infrastructure collapsing; hospitals at 50% capacity ; massive IDP influx from western highlands.
Aden	IRG control (PLC seat); pop ~800k	Major port and commercial hub. Partial restoration of services. Still plagued by insecurity, power cuts.
Taiz	Divided control (city split)	Iran-backed Houthi presence in highlands; IRG/Islah in city. Agriculture hub. City sees worst humanitarian crisis (blockade of roads, food shortages).
Hudaydah	Houthi-controlled; pop ~600k	Country’s main Red Sea port (80% of food/aid imports flow through it) . Industrial decline; targeting by IRG was halted in 2018.
Marib	IRG-Hadi stronghold (until Mar 2021); pop ~500k	Oil&gas fields (region’s backbone). Battles in 2020–21 as Houthis nearly captured city; pro-government tribes eventually held it. Key oil infrastructure remains largely under IRG control.
Mukalla (Hadramawt)	IRG control; pop ~300k	Former separatist capital. Oil/gas fields (Block 18, 14). Relative stability; Emirati withdrawal ended, Saudi aid projects.
Shabwa	Largely IRG (national army) w/ UAE proxies	Gas fields (Liquefied Gas terminal Balhaf). Recent tensions between UAE‑backed Security Belt vs IRG troops.
Socotra	UAE/STC influence (recently reconfirmed)**	Strategic island. UAE maintained small military presence (2018–2019); STC took control 2020. Maritime trade hub potential.

5. Social Conditions (Public Services)

The war has devastated Yemen’s social services.  Sana’a Center reports and UN data paint a dire picture: healthcare and education systems have collapsed.  Pre-conflict malnutrition was already “alarming” (nearly 45% of Yemenis food-insecure by 2011) ; by 2022 roughly 60% of people faced food insecurity . Public health indicators plummeted: maternal/child mortality soared, cholera epidemics broke out, and only ~50% of hospitals function .  Nearly half the population lacks safe water, and 90% lacks electricity .

Education:  Millions of children are out of school.  Sana’a Center notes “almost 2.7 million children” have been denied education by 2023 .  Many schools have closed or are used as shelters.  Teacher salaries in Houthi areas were paid (in Houthi rials) until 2016 but have since lapsed, while the south saw mass unpaid salaries until 2022. Learning outcomes were poor even pre-war (only ~8% of workers had post-secondary education ), and conflict has reversed any gains.

Healthcare: Coverage is extremely limited. Only half of hospitals are operational, and most clinics lack staff or supplies . Malnutrition is among the worst globally: in 2022 the Global Hunger Index labeled Yemen “alarming,” with nearly one-third of children under five stunted. The Sana’a Center emphasizes that “health and nutrition indicators imply human capital…was already very weak before the conflict” . The conflict has made conditions worse: continuous outbreaks of preventable disease (cholera, diphtheria, malaria, COVID) are reported. A humanitarian report notes urban areas (Sana’a, Aden) have better access than rural highlands or siege-bound Taiz.

Electricity/Water: Before the war, less than 50% had reliable electricity; now most areas get only hours per day of power (or rely on expensive generators or solar).  Water systems are in disrepair – 49% of Yemenis lack access to safe drinking water . Houthi-run regions charge high fees for water trucking. In the south, some Gulf-funded projects (e.g. Marib solar plant) aim to restore power, but grid fragmentation persists.

Social protection: Yemen has almost no effective social safety net. A Sana’a Center policy brief criticizes Yemen’s fragmented welfare (subsidies, ad hoc aid) and urges institutional reform  .  Government fuel and food subsidies collapsed with revenue loss. International aid covers only basic food/health relief; one analysis warns that scaling up development investment now is critical to avoid long-term regression .

6. External Actors and Aid

Yemen’s trajectory has been shaped by regional and international powers.  Sana’a Center’s Foreign Actors study (2021) details the extensive roles of Saudi Arabia, UAE, Iran, the US, UK, UN, and others . In brief:
	•	Saudi Arabia: The dominant foreign player. Historically Saudi mediated Yemeni politics and used migrant labor to influence Yemen’s economy . Post-2015, Riyadh leads the military coalition to “restore” Hadi, funds the southern government, and brokers inter-Yemeni deals. Saudi aid (often $1B+ per year) is a lifeline for the IRG. Conversely, Saudi enforced blockades (2015–18) crippled north; it also expelled Yemeni labor (1990 crisis) causing past economic collapse .
	•	United Arab Emirates: Initially coalition co-leader, the UAE focused on southern ports and proxy forces . It trained and funded the Giants Brigades, Security Belt and Hadrami Elite (defeating AQAP in Mukalla, 2016 ), and backed the STC political movement. By 2019 the UAE largely withdrew combat troops, maintaining influence through proxies .  UAE seeks maritime security: Socotra and Red Sea access are strategic, explaining its bases on Yemen’s west coast  . Saudi vs. UAE strategic divergence is evident: Riyadh prioritized fighting Houthis, while the UAE cultivated southern secessionists.
	•	Iran: Iran’s ties to the Houthis have grown significantly during the war. Prior to 2014, Saleh claimed Iranian meddling but Washington considered this exaggerated . After Saudi intervention, Iran began arming the Houthis with missiles and weapons (e.g. seized Jan 2013 “Jihan‑1” arms ship) . By 2020 Iran formalized relations (appointed an ambassador to Sana’a) . Houthi leaders openly chant slogans like “Death to America/Israel” rooted in Iran-aligned ideology (dating from founder Hussein al-Houthi’s mobilization over the 2000 Intifada ). Sana’a Center notes that Saudi miscalculated Iran’s role – the conflict has pushed the Houthis and Iran closer  .
	•	United States: The US approaches Yemen mainly as a counterterrorism concern and Saudi ally.  Post-9/11, the US partnered with Saleh against AQAP, conducting hundreds of drone strikes (332 strikes, 2010–2020) . Washington backed Gulf mediation in 2011‑12 and initially helped plan the 2015 intervention (even announcing the air campaign from DC) . The US provided logistics and arms to the coalition (air refueling to late 2018) . Under Biden, the US ended aerial refueling and briefly designated the Houthis as terrorists (Jan 2021), then revoked that (Feb 2021) under international humanitarian pressure . The US also leads UN Security Council pressure and provides humanitarian aid funding, though its Yemen attention is limited.
	•	United Kingdom & Europe: The UK has historical ties (former colonial in South Yemen) and remains a major arms supplier to Saudi . It co-chairs the “Friends of Yemen” groups and is active at the UN (British nationals have served as UN envoys). European and UN donors have run big relief programs (e.g. WFP feeding 13M people), but have often faced funding shortfalls and access constraints (especially after 2021 due to Houthi restrictions ).
	•	Oman: Ostensibly neutral, Oman did not join the 2015 coalition and has mediated quietly. It hosts exiled figures and facilitated talks, though accusations of Iranian missile smuggling via Omani territory strain relations . Oman has funded Mahri tribes opposing Saudi bases in Al-Mahra .
	•	GCC and Others: Qatar briefly joined the coalition (2015) but left in 2017 during the Gulf rift. It has supported some Islamist-aligned factions. Kuwait has hosted UN envoys. Turkey’s role is minimal. The Horn of Africa (Eritrea/Somalia) factors in maritime disputes (e.g. capture of Yemeni fishermen) and may affect Red Sea security.

Foreign aid: Before the war, Yemen relied on bilateral & multilateral aid. Since 2015, donor conferences (Riyadh, Geneva pledges) have raised ~$15–20B (with poor delivery). The IRG budget is propped by Saudi/UAE grants and World Bank/Arab Fund loans. Houthi areas have little external aid access; Houthis instead use captured assets (oil pipelines, telecom revenues) to finance themselves, creating parallel “state” revenues . Humanitarian appeals (UN OCHA, REDCROSS, etc.) raise ~$4–5B/year, less than needed. The UN considers Yemen “the world’s worst humanitarian crisis,” with UN and NGOs striving to meet basic needs in both territories.

7. Ports, Infrastructure and Trade

Yemen’s strategic ports and corridors have been central to the conflict:
	•	Hudaydah (Red Sea coast): Yemen’s largest port by tonnage (handles ~80% of imports and aid ). It fell under Houthi control in 2015. In 2018, IRG/UAE forces launched a battle for Hudaydah city (to sever Houthi supply), but under UN pressure they halted at city outskirts (Stockholm 2018) . Since then, Hudaydah’s port has remained in Houthi hands and is the main gateway for food/fuel flowing north . Damage from fighting and neglect has degraded its capacity, but UN-led “Operation Golden Sails” in 2023–24 repaired berths to renew grain imports.
	•	Aden & Mukalla (Gulf of Aden): Aden’s port is Yemen’s commercial hub in the south (multi‑purpose port, refinery). It has seen periods of fighting and improvements; Saudi and UAE invested in expanding its container port (Khalifa Port). Mukalla (Hadramawt) became AQAP’s 2015 stronghold until UAE‑backed forces liberated it. It now handles oil exports (Hadramawt fields) and commerce. Both ports remain operational under IRG/STC control, offering limited trade to north.
	•	Oil & Gas Infrastructure: Pre-war, two pipelines (Marib-Bir Ali to Hadhramawt and Suhar in Oman) existed. Warfare has mostly halted pipeline operations (the Shabwa export pipeline ceased in 2015). Marib remains Yemen’s largest gas producer (Marib Block 18) and some oil (Marib Light), which the IRG taps. The Houthis captured a limited portion of the Marib field but have not entirely cut it off. The Houthis also maintain one pipeline from Hadhramawt to Hodeidah (built pre-war) for domestic fuel. The unused FSO Safer oil tanker (Marib terminal) was a major environmental threat; UN talks in 2023 agreed to offload ~1.1M barrels . Yemen also has shale gas reserves (Tawila) and coal (Jawf) largely unrealized due to instability.
	•	Trade corridors: Yemen sits astride the Bab al-Mandeb strait (exit of Red Sea). Houthis have intermittently attacked shipping (oil tankers, container ships) since late 2019, aiming to pressure Israel’s blockade of Gaza. These strikes (50+ since Oct 2023) have disrupted global trade and triggered multinational naval patrols. Internally, land trade has fractured: the Riyadh–Sana’a highway via Ma’rib is the main north-south route, but Houthi blockades around Taiz (since 2018) and mountainous routes limit mobility. The Al-Mahra coast (east) connects by overland routes to Oman, which Saudi now secures (fearing Iranian influence).
	•	Natural resources: The Gulf of Aden coast (Balhaf LNG) and Masila oil fields are partly IRG-held and export some condensate. The Socotra Islands (off east coast) are strategically important for Red Sea traffic; the UAE’s 2018 deployment there (later STC takeover) reflects this.

8. Humanitarian and Development Indicators

Yemen’s war has precipitated a catastrophic humanitarian emergency and stalled development (SDG) progress.  Key indicators from Sana’a Center and UN reports include:
	•	Food security: In mid-2025, ~62% of households lack adequate food . Despite a partial improvement in Aden-area (rifted rial), severe food deprivation affects ~34% nationwide . Famine (IPC Phase 5) has been narrowly averted by massive aid, but ~18.1M people (60% of population) face acute food insecurity for late 2025 .
	•	Nutrition: Acute malnutrition (wasting) rates among children remain very high (10–15% national average, WHO) and chronic malnutrition (stunting) exceeds 40%. Outbreaks of cholera, measles and diphtheria exacerbate child mortality.
	•	Health: COVID-19 and other epidemics have cut into an already fragile system. Vaccination rates have plummeted. Only ~50% of health facilities function, and qualified health workers often flee conflict areas.
	•	Water/Sanitation: Over 2/5 of Yemenis lack safe water ; sanitation services are near collapse. Cholera endemic.
	•	Education: ~2.7 million children out of school (2023) . Yemen’s HDI ranking fell from 160th (2014) to 183rd (2023) .
	•	Poverty & Livelihoods: Poverty rates (~74% in 2022 ) far exceed pre-war (~40%). 2014 poverty was ~54%. Unemployment (32% in 2014) is much higher now; youth are particularly affected. 70%+ income drop means households rely on coping strategies (selling assets, child labor, irregular work).
	•	IDPs: Over 4.5 million internally displaced (mostly from western and central highlands) strain host communities, especially Marib (which has 1.5M IDPs). Millions are also effectively trapped by frontlines or checkpoints.
	•	Humanitarian response: 80% of aid flows through Hudaydah port . Since 2021, Houthi restrictions (permits, detentions of aid workers ) have hindered relief in the north. The north relies on an improvised “cash dole” via Houthis. UN and NGOs now operate mostly from southern bases, complicating aid to Houthi areas. OCHA’s annual appeals (>$4B) are chronically underfunded (~60%).
	•	SDG progress: All Sustainable Development Goals have regressed. Hunger (SDG2) is crisis-level; health (SDG3) and education (SDG4) indicators have reversed decades of gains. Infrastructure (SDG9) is ruined. Yemen will not meet targets without peace and massive investment. Sana’a Center analysts emphasize that “development assistance” (e.g. building schools, health clinics) is now urgent alongside relief  .

Yemen Deep Dive Report: Analysis of Key Publications and Reports (2015–2025)

This report synthesizes major analyses from the Sana’a Center for Strategic Studies and partner organizations as well as complementary sources from the World Bank, UN OCHA and other references.  Each section summarises a key publication, highlighting contextual background, main arguments, evidence and recommendations.  Together these materials build a detailed picture of Yemen’s political economy and humanitarian situation from 2015 to late‑2025.

1 Political and Governance Reform

1.1 “A New Approach to Reforming the Government of Yemen” (Sana’a Center, Oct 28 2025)
	•	Context:  The article opens by noting that in 2022 Yemen’s internationally recognised government replaced President Hadi with a Presidential Leadership Council (PLC) under pressure from Saudi Arabia .  The council has since struggled with fragmentation, corruption and lack of strategy.  Protests over unpaid salaries and collapsing services underscore the government’s dysfunction .
	•	Lost opportunities:  After the Houthis’ Red Sea attacks in late 2024, anti‑Houthi forces misjudged international dynamics.  They wasted much of 2024 appealing for external intervention rather than strengthening internal cohesion .  Early 2025 optimism that a renewed U.S. administration would designate the Houthis a terror organisation gave way to shock when Trump suspended operations after reaching an understanding with the group .
	•	Recent reforms and setbacks:  In mid‑2025, Prime Minister Salem bin Breik ensured cabinet meetings were held in Aden and oversaw economic reforms that allowed the rial to regain roughly half its value .  These reforms included creating an import‑financing committee and moving banks’ headquarters to Aden to centralise currency control .  Security forces also intercepted smuggled weapons .  However, by autumn 2025, internal quarrels resurfaced: STC official Salem Thabet al‑Awlaki resigned over corruption complaints and disputes between the prime minister and the central bank governor paralysed finances .  STC president Aidarous al‑Zubaidi’s unilateral decisions sparked controversy .
	•	Reform proposals:  The author argues that ad‑hoc reorganisations of the PLC (e.g., reducing members) will not fix structural weaknesses.  Instead, a proactive strategy is needed across four pillars :
	1.	Framework for political cohesion – adopt a declaration of principles to align PLC factions, draft bylaws limiting interference in cabinet work and adopt a unified strategic vision .  A unified negotiation team should prepare for future talks .
	2.	Institutional reform – prioritise capacity building in key institutions (prime minister’s office, central bank, defence ministry, judiciary, National Security Agency) .  A national committee should classify positions as political or technical to ensure merit‑based appointments .  Local authorities should be granted more autonomy, and a national digitization program and anti‑corruption campaign implemented .
	3.	Completion of economic reforms – adopt a state budget, consolidate revenues into the central bank, reform customs and tax collection, and liberalise the customs dollar rate to ensure subsidies target essential goods .
	4.	National defence strategy – unify and integrate armed forces, build partnerships with coalition allies, and maintain deterrence and offensive capability .
	•	Significance:  The article stresses that government reform is crucial not only to repel Houthi advances but also to preserve national legal and institutional foundations, which, if allowed to collapse, would intensify fragmentation and regional instability .

2 Macroeconomic and Monetary Issues

2.1 “Using IMF Support to Mitigate Currency Collapse” (Sana’a Center, Oct 22 2021)
	•	Context:  By late 2021 the Yemeni rial (YR) was collapsing in government‑controlled areas, trading at over 1,300 YR/US$ in Aden while remaining about 600 YR/US$ in Houthi areas .  Living costs surged, foreign currency reserves were depleted and protests erupted .
	•	IMF allocation:  The IMF allocated Yemen SDR 466.8 million (≈US$665 million) in August 2021 as part of a global COVID‑19 response .  Yemen’s cumulative SDR quota is worth around US$986 million .  SDRs can be exchanged for hard currency through voluntary swaps with IMF member states such as the US, UK and Saudi Arabia .  However, the SDR allocation is far below Yemen’s financial needs .
	•	Governance challenges:  The Aden‑based central bank (CBY‑Aden) has been plagued by mismanagement and corruption.  A UN panel accused CBY‑Aden officials of embezzling almost US$500 million from the Saudi deposit by offering importers preferential exchange rates .  Though the accusation was later withdrawn, the bank’s opaque operations and its rivalry with the Sana’a branch undermine confidence .
	•	Policy recommendations:
Form an Emergency Committee involving the CBY‑Aden, Finance Ministry, Economic Committee and other technocrats to transparently manage SDR funds .  The committee should set the import‑financing rate slightly below market rates, limit covered commodities to staples (excluding sugar) and publicise all transactions .
Replace CBY‑Aden leadership because current managers mishandled the Saudi deposit and lost credibility .
Maximise SDR utilisation by drawing the full US$986 million and tapping the IMF’s Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust and other donors .
Rebuild domestic revenue through oil and gas exports; international aid alone cannot sustain foreign reserves .
	•	Significance:  Without transparent deployment of SDRs, the currency crisis will continue to erode social order and humanitarian conditions.  Using IMF funds wisely could stabilise the rial and encourage additional aid .

2.2 “Yemen Without a Functioning Central Bank” (Sana’a Center, Nov 2 2016)
	•	Background:  In September 2016 President Hadi ordered Yemen’s Central Bank (CBY) headquarters moved from Sana’a to Aden, creating two rival institutions.  The CBY had previously been one of the few institutions providing nationwide services – paying 1.2 million civil servants’ salaries, financing imports and stabilising the currency .  The relocation deprived the country of an institution capable of basic economic stabilization .
	•	Humanitarian impact:  By October 2016, four of five Yemenis needed humanitarian aid and 370,000 children were acutely malnourished .  Civil servants were unpaid since August; these households (6 million people) lost income, accelerating famine  .  Without import credit, wheat supplies risked exhaustion within two months .
	•	Central bank’s pre‑war role:  The CBY coordinated with local councils to collect taxes and disburse salaries even after state authority eroded .  It financed government deficits through domestic borrowing (10 % of GDP by 2014) and maintained the rial’s value .  Following the 2011 uprising and civil war, this coordination continued despite frontlines .
	•	Risks of division:  The paper warns that neither the Aden nor Sana’a branch can function independently.  The Aden branch lacks staff and infrastructure; the Sana’a branch lacks international legitimacy .  A unilateral central bank by the Houthis would lack legitimacy and cause financial chaos .
	•	Recommended cooperation:  The authors argue for cooperation between the two branches.  External donors should pressure warring parties to respect CBY neutrality and avoid weaponising the economy .  Options include international supervision or holding aid in offshore accounts managed by independent committees under UN authority .  Ultimately, reinstating the CBY’s national role is critical to prevent famine and maintain humanitarian imports .

2.3 “The War for Monetary Control Enters a Dangerous New Phase” (Sana’a Center, Jan 21 2020)
	•	Summary:  Since Hadi’s relocation of the CBY to Aden (Sept 2016) two central banks have contested monetary control.  The Sana’a branch remains in the largest commercial centres; the Aden branch holds international recognition and prints currency .  In December 2019 the Sana’a branch banned newly printed Aden banknotes and introduced an electronic currency (e‑Rial) .
	•	Houthi ban on new currency:  The order required people in Houthi areas to trade banned notes for old pre‑2016 banknotes or e‑Rials within a month .  Those who failed risked confiscation and imprisonment .  The Sana’a bank specified three service providers for e‑Rial exchanges (M Floos, Mobile Money and Quality Connect) .  The ban caps official exchanges at 100,000 YR per person and covers only selected outlets .
	•	Past attempts:  Houthi authorities previously issued coupons for public‑sector salaries (2017) and launched e‑Rial pilots at the Yemen Petroleum Company (2018 and 2019), but these failed because merchants could not convert vouchers to cash and because Yemen is heavily cash‑based (only 6 % have bank accounts) .
	•	Enforcement and regional variation:  Enforcement was strongest in Sana’a and nearby governorates; in front‑line areas like Ibb or Taiz, new notes still circulate .  Businesses face liquidity shortages, and even qat sellers refuse Aden notes .  In some frontline areas, new notes still account for 60–70 % of currency .
	•	Market reaction:  The ban fostered black‑market currency trading and multiple exchange rates.  People traded new notes for old at discounts (e.g., 10,000 new rials exchanged for 9,000 old ones) .  Old notes are scarce and mostly damaged; as they exit circulation, exchange fees rise .  Exchange rates diverged: on Jan 14 2020 rials traded at YR655/US$ in Aden vs YR590/US$ in Sana’a, an 11 % difference .  Transfer fees between regions increased from <1 % to ~12 % .
	•	Implications:  The currency war deepens economic fragmentation, fuels inflation and drives ordinary Yemenis toward hard currencies (Saudi riyals, US dollars).  Without unified monetary governance, Yemen risks de facto economic partition and worsening humanitarian conditions .

3 Public Revenues and Fiscal Crisis

3.1 “Challenges to Yemen’s Public Revenues” (Sana’a Center, Dec 19 2023)
	•	Economic warfare:  Since April 2022 the conflict has shifted toward economic pressure.  The Houthis have blocked oil exports from IRG‑held ports, competed for customs revenues and banned cooking gas from government areas .  These measures decimated government revenue streams .
	•	Fiscal crisis:  Oil, gas and tax revenues have collapsed, leading to huge budget deficits and incapacity to pay salaries or maintain electricity .  Power plants shut down when a Saudi fuel grant expired, leaving Aden with only four hours of electricity a day .  Saudi Arabia’s August 2023 announcement of a US$1.2 billion grant offers temporary relief, but irregular aid cannot sustain the vast public sector .
	•	Policy avenues:  The paper proposes several options:
Exploit public assets – sell crude oil via restructured futures contracts or through private regional exporters; decentralize customs and tax collection .
Public‑private partnerships – invite private investment in electricity distribution and telecoms; study partial privatization to improve efficiency and revenue .
Reform public sector – rationalize the wage bill and subsidies; strengthen institutions; encourage the Gulf states to provide sustained financial support .  Without an economic truce and external funding, the government will face bankruptcy .
	•	Significance:  The fiscal crisis threatens the IRG’s legitimacy.  Without revenues to pay military forces and civil servants, its capacity to govern will collapse .  Restoring revenues and improving public‑finance management are critical for stabilization.

4 Development Finance and Economic Sectors

4.1 “Climate Finance in Fragile States: The Case of Yemen” (Policy Brief No. 33, Aug 11 2025)
	•	Climate vulnerability:  Yemen faces severe water scarcity (groundwater levels fall 3–8 m a year) and arable land shrinks 3–5 % annually.  Extreme weather events and health crises highlight the need for climate adaptation.
	•	Funding gaps:  Yemen received only US$0.60 per capita in adaptation finance between 2015–21, while stable countries received over US$100.  Obstacles include unclear criteria for funds, complex bureaucracy, bias toward mitigation over adaptation, and preference for loans over grants.  Yemen lacks accredited national institutions to access climate funds, forcing reliance on INGOs.
	•	Recommendations:  Establish a multi‑stakeholder climate task force and national climate fund; finalise Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs); improve regional cooperation and data collection.  International actors should simplify accreditation processes, prioritise grants and support Yemeni climate diplomacy.

4.2 “Enhancing the Role of Microfinance Banks for Sustainable Impact in Yemen” (Policy Brief 29, Sep 23 2024)
	•	Transformation of microfinance:  The conflict and split between rival central banks have spurred money‑exchange companies to become microfinance banks (MFBs).  Lower entry requirements make MFB licences attractive, and the surge could expand financial inclusion.
	•	Risks:  A fragmented central bank environment creates an uneven playing field and threatens financial stability.  Rural outreach is difficult; low financial literacy and cultural aversion to debt hinder client acquisition.  Inexperienced staff and fierce competition may lead to reckless lending and “mission drift,” focusing on urban clients.
	•	Opportunities:  MFBs can mobilize deposits and offer broader services than typical microfinance institutions; they hold potential to bridge the financial inclusion gap.  To succeed, the brief urges stronger regulation, a temporary moratorium on new licences, consolidation of MFB activities, capacity building, adoption of FinTech and creation of a national credit information system.

4.3 “Microfinance in Yemen: Overview of Challenges and Opportunities” (White Paper No. 6, Apr 2020)
	•	Historical development:  Microfinance began in Yemen in 1997, aiming to reduce poverty and unemployment.  The sector comprises formal microfinance banks (regulated by the CBY) and informal microfinance institutions (MFIs) funded by donors.
	•	Challenges:  The informal sector’s dependence on donor funds constrains long‑term planning.  The war disrupted operations and increased risks.  Microfinance institutions face poor management, low savings rates, religious opposition to interest and inflation.  Only a small share of Yemenis has formal financial accounts.
	•	Recommendations:  The paper calls for capacity building, improved financing (e.g., innovative risk‑sharing instruments), better program design (tailoring products to client needs) and further research.

4.4 “Fostering Opportunities for E‑Commerce Growth in Yemen” (Policy Brief 35, Sep 15 2025)
	•	Potential:  Yemen’s e‑commerce sector could drive growth and financial inclusion, particularly for women and rural communities.  Internet usage is only 17.7 % of the population (2024), but the arrival of Starlink offers promise.
	•	Challenges:  Poor internet connectivity, limited digital payment systems and lack of legal frameworks hinder development.  Yemen remains heavily cash‑based; only informal channels like Facebook and WhatsApp are used for online trade.  Conflict damage to transport networks restricts delivery.
	•	Recommendations:  Invest in satellite services (e.g., Starlink), develop cohesive e‑commerce regulations, improve digital literacy, enhance cybersecurity and promote public‑private cooperation to build infrastructure and digital payments.

4.5 “Impact Assessment of Aid Interventions in Yemen” (Dr Nadia Al‑Sakkaf, Mar 19 2025)
	•	Objective:  Traditional monitoring and evaluation often emphasise quantitative, short‑term results and neglect stakeholder perceptions.  This study introduces the Genuine Score of Impact (GSI) to assess aid projects’ real, lasting impacts on material wealth, social well‑being and empowerment.
	•	Method:  Mixed‑methods surveys and interviews were conducted in Lahj and Marib governorates, focusing on water, sanitation, health and food‑assistance projects.
	•	Findings:
	•	In Lahj, beneficiaries cited significant health benefits and improved community cohesion from health and sanitation interventions.
	•	In Marib, aid provided temporary relief but lacked sustainability.  Non‑beneficiary communities complained of unfulfilled needs and poor governance.
	•	Significance:  The GSI framework highlights the need to include community perceptions and long‑term impacts in aid evaluations and emphasises that aid programmes must consider sustainability and stakeholder engagement.

5 Key Cross‑Cutting Insights
	1.	Dual central banks and currency war:  The 2016 split created two competing CBY branches, leading to a fractured monetary policy.  The Houthis’ ban on new Aden banknotes and attempts to introduce e‑Rials triggered black‑market trading, multiple exchange rates and deeper economic fragmentation .  Without cooperation between branches, monetary chaos will persist .
	2.	Fiscal collapse:  Oil exports and tax revenues have declined sharply because of Houthi blockades and economic warfare .  The internationally recognised government faces budget deficits and relies on irregular Saudi aid to pay salaries and electricity .
	3.	Institutional weakness:  Governance is hampered by political divisions within the PLC and corruption at key institutions like the CBY‑Aden  .  Strengthening institutions and anti‑corruption mechanisms is crucial for reform.
	4.	Humanitarian crisis and aid effectiveness:  Millions of Yemenis are near famine; civil servants’ salaries remain unpaid; and aid programmes often lack sustainability .  Evaluating aid through local perceptions and long‑term impact (GSI) can improve programme design.
	5.	Development finance:  Access to climate finance and microfinance is limited by institutional capacity and regulatory gaps.  Policy briefs call for creating national funds, task forces, robust regulation and strengthening microfinance banks to expand financial inclusion.
	6.	Digital economy opportunities:  Despite poor infrastructure, there is potential for e‑commerce and FinTech to drive economic growth.  Policymakers must invest in connectivity, digital literacy and consumer protection to unlock this potential.

Conclusion

The reviewed sources collectively depict a Yemen trapped in a vicious cycle of political fragmentation, economic collapse and humanitarian crisis.  Reforms must tackle structural governance flaws, unify monetary policy, restore public revenue streams and invest in institutional capacity.  International support, whether through IMF SDRs, climate finance, or humanitarian aid, will only be effective if managed transparently and used to rebuild institutions.  At the same time, forward‑looking initiatives—such as fostering e‑commerce, expanding microfinance and accessing climate finance—offer pathways to inclusive growth if regulatory barriers are addressed.  Understanding the complexities of Yemen’s economy and society requires continuous monitoring of these dynamic factors and integration of local perspectives to craft sustainable solutions.

	•	Houthi ban on new currency:  The order required people in Houthi areas to trade banned notes for old pre‑2016 banknotes or e‑Rials within a month .  Those who failed risked confiscation and imprisonment .  The Sana’a bank specified three service providers for e‑Rial exchanges (M Floos, Mobile Money and Quality Connect) .  The ban caps official exchanges at 100,000 YR per person and covers only selected outlets .
	•	Past attempts:  Houthi authorities previously issued coupons for public‑sector salaries (2017) and launched e‑Rial pilots at the Yemen Petroleum Company (2018 and 2019), but these failed because merchants could not convert vouchers to cash and because Yemen is heavily cash‑based (only 6 % have bank accounts) .
In April 2017, the Houthi‑Saleh government rolled out a food‑voucher system to partially pay roughly one million public and mixed‑sector employees who had gone without salaries since September 2016.  Vouchers covered staples such as wheat, rice, cooking oil, milk powder and flour and were redeemable at selected markets .  Economists warned that the scheme would be short‑lived because the authorities lacked cash to reimburse merchants, forcing sellers to charge dual prices for cash and coupons and eroding the coupons’ value within months .  The inability to convert vouchers into cash meant the system collapsed quickly, leaving workers uncompensated.
In early 2018 and again in April 2019, the Houthi‑run “National Salvation Government” attempted to address the liquidity crisis by introducing an electronic rial (e‑Rial) system.  The Yemen Petroleum Company (YPC) was selected for the initial trial after other public institutions refused to use electronic salaries .  Workers protested and some organisers were detained, and the pilot stalled.  Economists at the Sana’a Center cautioned that replacing physical banknotes with digital credits would spur price disparities between cash and e‑Rials and exacerbate demand for hard currency .  These failed experiments underscored how Yemen’s predominantly cash‑based economy – where only about 6 percent of adults have bank accounts – constrains electronic payment schemes.
	•	Enforcement and regional variation:  Enforcement was strongest in Sana’a and nearby governorates; in front‑line areas like Ibb or Taiz, new notes still circulate .  Businesses face liquidity shortages, and even qat sellers refuse Aden notes .  In some frontline areas, new notes still account for 60–70 % of currency .
	•	Market reaction:  The ban fostered black‑market currency trading and multiple exchange rates.  People traded new notes for old at discounts (e.g., 10,000 new rials exchanged for 9,000 old ones) .  Old notes are scarce and mostly damaged; as they exit circulation, exchange fees rise .  Exchange rates diverged: on Jan 14 2020 rials traded at YR655/US$ in Aden vs YR590/US$ in Sana’a, an 11 % difference .  Transfer fees between regions increased from <1 % to ~12 % .
	•	Implications:  The currency war deepens economic fragmentation, fuels inflation and drives ordinary Yemenis toward hard currencies (Saudi riyals, US dollars).  Without unified monetary governance, Yemen risks de facto economic partition and worsening humanitarian conditions .

3 Public Revenues and Fiscal Crisis

3.1 “Challenges to Yemen’s Public Revenues” (Sana’a Center, Dec 19 2023)
	•	Economic warfare:  Since April 2022 the conflict has shifted toward economic pressure.  The Houthis have blocked oil exports from IRG‑held ports, competed for customs revenues and banned cooking gas from government areas .  These measures decimated government revenue streams .
	•	Fiscal crisis:  Oil, gas and tax revenues have collapsed, leading to huge budget deficits and incapacity to pay salaries or maintain electricity .  Power plants shut down when a Saudi fuel grant expired, leaving Aden with only four hours of electricity a day .  Saudi Arabia’s August 2023 announcement of a US$1.2 billion grant offers temporary relief, but irregular aid cannot sustain the vast public sector .
	•	Policy avenues:  The paper proposes several options:
Exploit public assets – sell crude oil via restructured futures contracts or through private regional exporters; decentralize customs and tax collection .
Public‑private partnerships – invite private investment in electricity distribution and telecoms; study partial privatization to improve efficiency and revenue .
Reform public sector – rationalize the wage bill and subsidies; strengthen institutions; encourage the Gulf states to provide sustained financial support .  Without an economic truce and external funding, the government will face bankruptcy .
	•	Significance:  The fiscal crisis threatens the IRG’s legitimacy.  Without revenues to pay military forces and civil servants, its capacity to govern will collapse .  Restoring revenues and improving public‑finance management are critical for stabilization.

4 Development Finance and Economic Sectors

4.1 “Climate Finance in Fragile States: The Case of Yemen” (Policy Brief No. 33, Aug 11 2025)
	•	Climate vulnerability:  Yemen faces severe water scarcity (groundwater levels fall 3–8 m a year) and arable land shrinks 3–5 % annually.  Extreme weather events and health crises highlight the need for climate adaptation.
	•	Funding gaps:  Yemen received only US$0.60 per capita in adaptation finance between 2015–21, while stable countries received over US$100.  Obstacles include unclear criteria for funds, complex bureaucracy, bias toward mitigation over adaptation, and preference for loans over grants.  Yemen lacks accredited national institutions to access climate funds, forcing reliance on INGOs.
	•	Recommendations:  Establish a multi‑stakeholder climate task force and national climate fund; finalise Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs); improve regional cooperation and data collection.  International actors should simplify accreditation processes, prioritise grants and support Yemeni climate diplomacy.

4.2 “Enhancing the Role of Microfinance Banks for Sustainable Impact in Yemen” (Policy Brief 29, Sep 23 2024)
	•	Transformation of microfinance:  The conflict and split between rival central banks have spurred money‑exchange companies to become microfinance banks (MFBs).  Lower entry requirements make MFB licences attractive, and the surge could expand financial inclusion.
	•	Risks:  A fragmented central bank environment creates an uneven playing field and threatens financial stability.  Rural outreach is difficult; low financial literacy and cultural aversion to debt hinder client acquisition.  Inexperienced staff and fierce competition may lead to reckless lending and “mission drift,” focusing on urban clients.
	•	Opportunities:  MFBs can mobilize deposits and offer broader services than typical microfinance institutions; they hold potential to bridge the financial inclusion gap.  To succeed, the brief urges stronger regulation, a temporary moratorium on new licences, consolidation of MFB activities, capacity building, adoption of FinTech and creation of a national credit information system.

4.3 “Microfinance in Yemen: Overview of Challenges and Opportunities” (White Paper No. 6, Apr 2020)
	•	Historical development:  Microfinance began in Yemen in 1997, aiming to reduce poverty and unemployment.  The sector comprises formal microfinance banks (regulated by the CBY) and informal microfinance institutions (MFIs) funded by donors.
	•	Challenges:  The informal sector’s dependence on donor funds constrains long‑term planning.  The war disrupted operations and increased risks.  Microfinance institutions face poor management, low savings rates, religious opposition to interest and inflation.  Only a small share of Yemenis has formal financial accounts.
	•	Recommendations:  The paper calls for capacity building, improved financing (e.g., innovative risk‑sharing instruments), better program design (tailoring products to client needs) and further research.

4.4 “Fostering Opportunities for E‑Commerce Growth in Yemen” (Policy Brief 35, Sep 15 2025)
	•	Potential:  Yemen’s e‑commerce sector could drive growth and financial inclusion, particularly for women and rural communities.  Internet usage is only 17.7 % of the population (2024), but the arrival of Starlink offers promise.
	•	Challenges:  Poor internet connectivity, limited digital payment systems and lack of legal frameworks hinder development.  Yemen remains heavily cash‑based; only informal channels like Facebook and WhatsApp are used for online trade.  Conflict damage to transport networks restricts delivery.
	•	Recommendations:  Invest in satellite services (e.g., Starlink), develop cohesive e‑commerce regulations, improve digital literacy, enhance cybersecurity and promote public‑private cooperation to build infrastructure and digital payments.

4.5 “Impact Assessment of Aid Interventions in Yemen” (Dr Nadia Al‑Sakkaf, Mar 19 2025)
	•	Objective:  Traditional monitoring and evaluation often emphasise quantitative, short‑term results and neglect stakeholder perceptions.  This study introduces the Genuine Score of Impact (GSI) to assess aid projects’ real, lasting impacts on material wealth, social well‑being and empowerment.
	•	Method:  Mixed‑methods surveys and interviews were conducted in Lahj and Marib governorates, focusing on water, sanitation, health and food‑assistance projects.
	•	Findings:
	•	In Lahj, beneficiaries cited significant health benefits and improved community cohesion from health and sanitation interventions.
	•	In Marib, aid provided temporary relief but lacked sustainability.  Non‑beneficiary communities complained of unfulfilled needs and poor governance.
	•	Significance:  The GSI framework highlights the need to include community perceptions and long‑term impacts in aid evaluations and emphasises that aid programmes must consider sustainability and stakeholder engagement.

5 Key Cross‑Cutting Insights
	1.	Dual central banks and currency war:  The 2016 split created two competing CBY branches, leading to a fractured monetary policy.  The Houthis’ ban on new Aden banknotes and attempts to introduce e‑Rials triggered black‑market trading, multiple exchange rates and deeper economic fragmentation .  Without cooperation between branches, monetary chaos will persist .
	2.	Fiscal collapse:  Oil exports and tax revenues have declined sharply because of Houthi blockades and economic warfare .  The internationally recognised government faces budget deficits and relies on irregular Saudi aid to pay salaries and electricity .
	3.	Institutional weakness:  Governance is hampered by political divisions within the PLC and corruption at key institutions like the CBY‑Aden  .  Strengthening institutions and anti‑corruption mechanisms is crucial for reform.
	4.	Humanitarian crisis and aid effectiveness:  Millions of Yemenis are near famine; civil servants’ salaries remain unpaid; and aid programmes often lack sustainability .  Evaluating aid through local perceptions and long‑term impact (GSI) can improve programme design.
	5.	Development finance:  Access to climate finance and microfinance is limited by institutional capacity and regulatory gaps.  Policy briefs call for creating national funds, task forces, robust regulation and strengthening microfinance banks to expand financial inclusion.
	6.	Digital economy opportunities:  Despite poor infrastructure, there is potential for e‑commerce and FinTech to drive economic growth.  Policymakers must invest in connectivity, digital literacy and consumer protection to unlock this potential.

## 6 Recent Political and Security Developments (2024–2025)

The quarterly Yemen Review series by the Sana’a Center provides granular updates on the shifting military, diplomatic and economic landscape. Two recent editions—January–March 2025 and July–September 2024—illustrate how international interventions and domestic fragmentation continue to shape Yemen’s trajectory.

### 6.1 The Yemen Review: January–March 2025 (Published April 21 2025)
	•	Operation Rough Rider and US policy shifts:  In mid‑March 2025, the United States under President Donald Trump launched Operation Rough Rider, a large‑scale air campaign against the Houthi movement.  The campaign targeted missile depots, underground installations and senior leaders; as of April 14, at least 123 civilians and an estimated 101 Houthi combatants were reported killed .  The strikes followed Trump’s re‑designation of the Houthis as a Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO) on March 4, reversing the Biden administration’s 2021 rescission.  Sanctions were broadened to include Yemen Kuwait Bank, disrupting remittances and aid flows and severing the bank from international financial systems .  OFAC revised general licences to allow humanitarian transactions but imposed strict controls on refined petroleum imports .
	•	Humanitarian and economic fallout:  The FTO designation and airstrikes aggravated an already dire humanitarian situation.  WFP reported that 62 percent of Yemenis faced inadequate food consumption, up 15 percent year‑on‑year .  The rial plummeted to record lows in government areas while fuel shortages caused prolonged blackouts .  USAID temporarily suspended funding, forcing the WFP to halt dozens of projects .  Banks in Houthi areas risk losing access to SWIFT and remittance networks unless they relocate to Aden .
	•	Internal government tensions:  Political infighting within the Presidential Leadership Council (PLC) intensified.  Prime Minister Ahmed Awad bin Mubarak clashed with PLC chief Rashad al‑Alimi over cabinet appointments and anti‑corruption investigations .  Saudi Arabia convened PLC members in Riyadh to defuse tensions and insisted that officials return to Aden, but security fears kept many abroad .  A leaked report showing that PLC members had collected over US$104 million in salaries and allowances since 2022 fueled public outrage .
	•	Hadramawt tribal mobilization:  The oil‑rich governorate of Hadramawt witnessed new calls for autonomy.  Deputy governor Amr bin Habrish led the Hadramawt Tribal Alliance (HTA) in blocking fuel shipments to Aden until demands for local control and a greater share of oil revenues were met .  The HTA announced the formation of a Hadramawt Protection Force, prompting condemnation from UAE‑backed military units .  PLC member and former governor Faraj al‑Bahsani staged a walkout to protest the lack of progress on decentralization promises .
	•	Suspension of maritime attacks and renewed escalation:  In January 2025 the Houthis temporarily suspended Red Sea attacks on shipping, contributing to a brief resurgence of maritime traffic .  However, the group threatened to resume attacks if negotiations with Israel faltered, and in March the US renewed airstrikes in response to a Houthi ultimatum that aid be allowed into Gaza .  Operation Rough Rider then expanded to target Houthi leadership and infrastructure, escalating regional tensions .
	•	Significance:  The January–March 2025 review underscores how external actors (particularly the US and Saudi Arabia) and internal divisions (within the PLC and between regional factions) shape Yemen’s conflict.  Sanctions and counterterrorism measures risk worsening humanitarian conditions and fragmenting the financial sector, while tribal mobilisation in Hadramawt highlights the fragility of central authority.

### 6.2 The Yemen Review: July–September 2024 (Published Oct 16 2024)
	•	Houthi–Israeli escalation:  On July 19 2024, a Houthi drone struck Tel Aviv, killing one person—the first Houthi attack to cause casualties in Israel .  Israel retaliated with airstrikes on the port of Hudaydah, destroying fuel stores and raising concerns about interruptions to humanitarian aid .  Further Houthi attacks on September 15 prompted additional Israeli strikes on port and power facilities .
	•	Red Sea dynamics:  Red Sea attacks on shipping fell from 21 incidents to 12 during the quarter, partly because the US and UK destroyed 141 weapons systems .  Yet the Houthis continued to threaten shipping, and an attack on the Greek tanker Sounion highlighted environmental risks .
	•	Domestic turmoil:  Fighting between Houthi and pro‑government forces persisted across frontlines such as Taiz‑Lahj, Hudaydah and Marib .  Houthi authorities arrested hundreds ahead of the September 26 republic revolution anniversary and aired forced confessions of detained embassy staff .  They also reshuffled their cabinet, appointing loyalists and expanding control over the judiciary .
	•	Political contestation and disasters:  In the south, protests erupted after the kidnapping of a pro‑government commander, undermining Southern Transitional Council (STC) authority .  In Hadramawt, rumours of revenue‑sharing deals with the Houthis spurred tribal groups to block fuel shipments and demand autonomy .  Heavy flooding during the kharif rain season killed nearly 100 people and affected over half a million, damaging farmland and exacerbating cholera outbreaks .
	•	Central bank showdown:  The Aden‑based CBY attempted to sever six Sana’a banks from the SWIFT network to assert authority but backed down under Riyadh’s orders after the Houthis threatened retaliation .  The episode illustrated the delicate balance between competing branches of the central bank and the influence of Saudi Arabia on economic decisions.
	•	Significance:  The July–September 2024 review shows a conflict spilling across borders and into the Red Sea.  Israeli strikes on Hudaydah marked a new regional dimension to the war, while domestic governance crises—including Houthi repression, STC infighting, and tribal contestation—highlight the disintegration of state authority.  Environmental disasters further strained the country, and the central bank clash pointed to persistent monetary fragmentation.

Conclusion

The reviewed sources collectively depict a Yemen trapped in a vicious cycle of political fragmentation, economic collapse and humanitarian crisis.  Reforms must tackle structural governance flaws, unify monetary policy, restore public revenue streams and invest in institutional capacity.  International support, whether through IMF SDRs, climate finance, or humanitarian aid, will only be effective if managed transparently and used to rebuild institutions.  At the same time, forward‑looking initiatives—such as fostering e‑commerce, expanding microfinance and accessing climate finance—offer pathways to inclusive growth if regulatory barriers are addressed.  Understanding the complexities of Yemen’s economy and society requires continuous monitoring of these dynamic factors and integration of local perspectives to craft sustainable solutions.

Financial and Banking‑Related Publications at the Sana’a Center (2015‑2025)

This document catalogues every report, analysis, policy brief and editorial from the Sana’a Center for Strategic Studies (Sana’a Center) that deals primarily with financial issues, banking, the Central Bank of Yemen (CBY) or monetary policy.  The list covers publications from 2015 through late 2025 and summarises the key points and findings of each piece.  Where possible, citations from the original articles are provided to anchor specific facts.

Overview

Yemen’s banking system and monetary policy have been a focus of the Sana’a Center since the outbreak of the war.  The Central Bank’s relocation from Sana’a to Aden in 2016 and its subsequent bifurcation created two competing monetary authorities.  This split, combined with currency printing, sanctions, foreign interference and the proliferation of informal money exchanges, has destabilised the Yemeni rial, undermined public confidence in banks and contributed to severe inflation.  The Sana’a Center’s financial publications trace this evolving crisis, propose reforms and document the humanitarian consequences of monetary collapse.

Chronological Catalogue of Financial & Banking Publications

2016: Early warnings and the CBY relocation

Date	Publication	Type	Key points & insights
Feb 25 2016	“Ensuring Yemen’s state structures survive the conflict: The imminent critical threats to the Yemeni rial and government institutions”	Main publication	Warned that Yemen’s fragile state institutions and the Central Bank of Yemen (CBY) were at risk of collapse due to war and budget deficits.  Highlighted the CBY’s role in stabilising the rial and paying public salaries, and stressed that currency depreciation would devastate purchasing power and fuel social unrest .  Recommended preserving the CBY’s autonomy and avoiding measures that would erode public trust.
May 15 2016	“Beware of the Failure of Yemen’s Central Bank”	Analysis	Described the CBY as one of the last functioning national institutions.  Noted that foreign exchange reserves were dwindling; to slow the currency’s depreciation the CBY governor limited foreign transfers and banned cashing foreign remittances to stop dollar outflows .  Warned that a CBY collapse would accelerate monetary deterioration and exacerbate the humanitarian crisis.
Sep 2016	“Yemen at the UN – September 2016 Review”	Yemen at the UN	Reported that the internationally recognised government decided to relocate the CBY from Sana’a to Aden, which UN experts warned would worsen the humanitarian catastrophe .  This relocation marked the start of the CBY split, leading to rival central banks and currency fragmentation.
Nov 2 2016	“Yemen Without a Functioning Central Bank: The Loss of Basic Economic Stabilization and Accelerating Famine”	Main publication	Explained that relocating the CBY removed the only institution capable of stabilising the economy.  Before 2016, the CBY maintained public salaries and import financing, preventing famine.  After relocation, civil servants went unpaid, liquidity dried up and the black‑market exchange rate surged; foreign reserves fell from about US$6 billion to US$2.1 billion, accelerating inflation .  The report urged empowering the CBY to resume payments and import credits .

2017: Rising currency volatility and arbitrage

Date	Publication	Type	Key points & insights
Mar 31 2017	“Rapid currency depreciation and the decimation of Yemeni purchasing power”	Analysis	Detailed how the relocation of the CBY and loss of foreign reserves triggered a sharp depreciation of the rial, destroying purchasing power in a country that imports almost 90 % of its food.  Noted that both CBY branches imposed capital controls and sought foreign support, but without coordinated policy the rial continued to fall .
Sep 6 2017	“How currency arbitrage has reduced the funds available to address the humanitarian crisis”	Economic bulletin	Described how humanitarian funds lost value when exchanged at official rates that differed from market rates.  Banks exploited the gap between the official (YR250/USD) and parallel market (~YR350/USD) exchange rates, earning windfall profits while aid agencies lost purchasing power .  Recommended establishing a special exchange rate for humanitarian operations and coordinating between the CBY and aid agencies.
Oct 31 2017	“Renewed rapid currency depreciation and diverging monetary policy between Sana’a and Aden”	Economic bulletin	Warned that the rial’s plunge and diverging monetary policies could lead to two separate monetary systems in Yemen.  The bulletin noted that exchange rate volatility threatened humanitarian operations and called for unified monetary governance .


Date	Publication	Type	Key points & insights
Feb 8 2018	“Restoring central bank capacity and stabilizing the rial”	Policy brief	Urged international actors to re‑empower the CBY.  Recommended regulating currency printing, coordinating with commercial banks and money exchangers, paying interest on treasury bills and relocating CBY leadership back to Yemen .  The brief warned that without action the rial would collapse and humanitarian conditions would worsen.
Oct 16 2018	“Famine at Hand Without a Reunified Central Bank to Protect the Yemeni Rial”	Editorial	Argued that currency collapse was the greatest threat to Yemenis and could spark famine.  Criticised the printing of new notes and salary increases, emphasising that reunifying the CBY and securing foreign currency support were essential .


Date	Publication	Type	Key points & insights
Feb 2019	“Revitalizing Yemen’s Banking Sector”	Policy brief (PDF)	Provided a comprehensive analysis of the banking sector’s liquidity crisis, split central bank and loss of public confidence.  Highlighted banks’ frozen assets, restrictions on cross‑border transactions and the erosion of the rial.  Recommended reunifying the CBY, reactivating anti‑money‑laundering mechanisms, releasing retained balances, facilitating secure transfers, easing import financing, replacing damaged banknotes and resuming partial debt servicing .


Date	Publication	Type	Key points & insights
Jan 21 2020	“The War for Monetary Control Enters a Dangerous New Phase”	Economic bulletin	Discussed how the CBY‑Sana’a banned newly printed Aden notes and introduced an electronic rial (e‑Rial) to mitigate inflation.  The bulletin warned that the ban deepened economic fragmentation, created parallel exchange rates and spurred black‑market trading .  It described the history of Yemen’s currency war, starting with the Houthi takeover and culminating in the ban.
Nov 27 2020	“Battle to Regulate Banks Threatens to Rupture the Financial Sector”	Economic bulletin	Documented the battle between the CBY branches over access to banks’ data.  CBY‑Sana’a banned banks from sharing data with Aden and threatened fines, while CBY‑Aden threatened prosecution.  The escalating dispute risked collapse of the banking sector and further erosion of confidence .


Date	Publication	Type	Key points & insights
Mar 26 2021	“The CBY‑Aden’s Crisis of Confidence – Assessing the UN Panel of Experts’ Corruption Allegations”	Analysis	Responded to UN allegations that CBY‑Aden had engaged in money‑laundering and corruption.  The article argued that the panel’s methodology was flawed but acknowledged that the CBY lacked transparency and oversight.  It called for audits, new leadership and reforms to restore trust .
Dec 17 2021	“Limited Efficacy of US Sanctions on Houthi Financial Networks”	Economic bulletin	Examined US sanctions against Houthi‑linked networks such as Swaid & Sons.  Found that sanctions pushed financial flows to informal hawala networks and limited banks’ access to foreign currency, threatening humanitarian imports .  Warned that sanctions might exacerbate Yemen’s economic fragmentation and urged a review of their humanitarian impacts .


Date	Publication	Type	Key points & insights
Jan 2022	“Public Debt in Yemen – Debt Restructuring or Default” (Yemen Socio‑Economic Update Issue 15)	External (MoPIC report; referenced by Sana’a Center)	Explored Yemen’s soaring public debt and options for restructuring or default.  Noted that by 2015 the CBY was financing 84 % of the government’s budget deficit and that banks stopped purchasing public debt instruments after the conflict escalated .  Called for debt restructuring and coordination between rival CBY branches to ensure fiscal sustainability.
May 8 2020	“Lebanon’s Financial Collapse Traps Yemeni Banks’ Money” (cross‑year but relevant to 2020–2022)	Economic bulletin	Explained how Yemeni banks had used Lebanese banks to hold foreign currency because of risk‑de‑risking in Gulf banks.  When Lebanon’s financial crisis unfolded, roughly US$240 million of Yemeni deposits were trapped, threatening import financing and undermining the banking sector .

Date	Publication	Type	Key points & insights
Mar 2023	“Houthis Ban Interest in Banking Sector” (Yemen Review, March 2023)	Report	Covered the Houthis’ passage of a law banning interest (riba) in banking transactions.  The law required banks to convert all deposits and loans into Islamic financing instruments, prompting warnings from the Yemeni Banking Association that it could cause bank runs and contraction of credit .
Mar 2 2023	“Bridging the Divide: Mitigating the Impacts of the CBY Schism on Yemen’s Banking Sector”	Policy brief	An in‑depth study of the banking sector after the CBY split.  Documented the liquidity crisis, currency divergence and migration of financial flows to informal networks.  Noted that CBY‑Sana’a adopted Islamic finance and banned interest, while CBY‑Aden printed new notes to pay salaries, spurring recurrent exchange‑rate volatility.  Proposed mediation and a unified mechanism to manage government revenues and expenditures .
March 2023 (Yemen Review)	“Game of Parliaments – The Yemen Review” (April 2019)	Report	In April 2019, Houthi authorities attempted to implement an electronic rial payment system (e‑Rial) due to liquidity shortages and refusal to accept Aden‑printed banknotes.  The system was trialed by the Yemen Petroleum Company but prompted protests and raised concerns over dual pricing .  Though launched earlier, this initiative is revisited in 2023 commentary on the currency war.
April 14 2023	“Challenges to Yemen’s Public Revenues – The Yemen Review, March 2023”	Report	Analysed how Houthi blockades of oil exports and competing authorities’ battles over customs revenues decimated government finances.  Recommended selling crude through futures contracts, decentralising customs and working with the private sector to shore up revenues, but emphasised that an economic truce and institutional reform were crucial .
April 2023	“Public servants receiving salary payments from Aden…” (section of Yemen Review)	Report	Explained that the Aden-based government still pays some public sector salaries (judiciary, audit authority, universities, health sector).  These salaries are financed at a preferential exchange rate (YR570/USD) for food imports, while oil derivatives are funded at a rate 10 % below the parallel market .  The article highlights the dual exchange-rate system used to manage food and fuel imports.
March 2021 (but relevant to 2023)	“The CBY‑Aden’s Crisis of Confidence”	Analysis	[See 2021 above]


Date	Publication	Type	Key points & insights
Dec 2024	“Rescuing Yemen’s Economy: Resetting Expectations for Monetary Stabilization”	Analysis	Provided a wide‑ranging assessment of Yemen’s economy after years of war.  Emphasised that the rial plunged beyond YR2,000/USD and the IRG’s revenues fell by half in 2023 and 42 % in the first half of 2024; oil exports were suspended and customs revenues shifted to Houthi‑controlled ports .  Argued that only external financial support and a unified currency could stabilise the rial, and urged donors to support debt restructuring, pay salaries and coordinate with both CBY branches .
Sept 23 2024	“Enhancing the Role of Microfinance Banks for Sustainable Impact in Yemen”	Policy brief	Noted that Yemen’s microfinance sector has undergone a radical transformation due to the CBY split and loss of confidence in banks.  Licenses for microfinance banks multiplied, but these institutions faced financial instability, dispersion of branch networks and low financial literacy.  Called for a temporary licensing moratorium, capacity‑building, FinTech adoption and regulation to ensure microfinance banks contribute to financial inclusion .
Oct 2024	“Yemen Monthly Economic Update – World Bank” (external)	Report (referenced)	Highlighted the continuing decline of Yemen’s GDP and emphasised that telecoms were the second‑largest source of foreign currency after oil and gas .  Recommended reforms in the telecom sector, noting that revenue shortfalls and corruption undermined public finances.
Date	Publication	Type	Key points & insights
Jul 18 2025	“Currency War Threatens to Deepen Yemen’s Monetary Rift”	Analysis	Reported that the Houthi CBY‑Sana’a issued new 50‑ and 200‑rial coins and banknotes, which CBY‑Aden denounced as counterfeit.  Noted that issuing coins could pave the way for higher‑denomination bills (500 and 1,000 rials) and further monetary fragmentation.  Explained that the FTO designation of the Houthis forced banks to relocate operations to Aden and undergo third‑party scrutiny; previous economic warfare strategies were rolled back under Saudi pressure .
Aug 19 2025	“Rial Surges Under Revitalized Central Bank”	Analysis	Detailed how the CBY‑Aden’s reforms (cracking down on speculation, launching a National Committee for Regulating and Financing Imports and restricting foreign currency use) caused the rial to appreciate by over 44 %.  The article noted that the currency had collapsed to YR2,900/USD due to speculation and the proliferation of exchange shops, but reforms boosted confidence and reduced the price of food and fuel .  It cautioned that continued coordination with the private sector and donor support were needed to sustain stability .

Ensuring Yemen’s State Structures Survive the Conflict (Feb 2016)

Context

By early 2016, Yemen’s war had destroyed much of the country’s infrastructure and fractured political authority.  The Houthis and allied forces had seized Sana’a in September 2014 and pushed President Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi’s government to the southern city of Aden.  The Saudi‑led coalition intervened militarily in March 2015, imposing a sea, land and air blockade that halted oil exports and cut customs revenues.  This analysis, written by Mansour Rageh for the Sana’a Center in February 2016, warned that Yemen’s Central Bank of Yemen (CBY) and core state institutions were on the brink of collapse.  It argued that preserving the currency and the bare minimum of government operations was essential to avert famine and facilitate post‑war reconstruction.

Structural weaknesses in public finances
	•	Reliance on oil and corruption:  Prior to the conflict, Yemen’s government revenue was heavily dependent on oil exports and plagued by patronage networks .  Between 2009‑2013, budget deficits ranged from 4.6–8.3 % of GDP, with spending exceeding revenue by 16–27 % each year .  Oil exports accounted for about two‑thirds of revenue .
	•	2015 budget crisis:  The 2015 budget projected US$10.3 billion in revenue (46 % from oil, 31.8 % from taxes and customs, 8 % from external grants) against US$13.4 billion in spending, implying a deficit of US$3.1 billion .  Yet actual revenue available was estimated at only US$4.6 billion, or 44 % of the projection, due to the collapse of oil exports, customs receipts and foreign aid .  Operational expenses, mainly public sector salaries and debt service, remained about US$700 million per month, totaling US$8.5 billion for the year.  This created a funding gap of roughly US$3.9 billion just to keep essential services running .
	•	Seizure of state revenues:  Warring parties were seizing public companies and siphoning revenues.  The Houthis took over state firms like the National Tobacco & Matches Company and allowed black‑market dealers to replace the Yemen Petroleum Company (YPC) as fuel importer .  These illicit activities enriched war profiteers and deprived the government of customs and fuel taxes .

Central Bank of Yemen’s role and vulnerabilities

The CBY remained one of the last functional state institutions.  Its mandate included maintaining the riyal’s value, financing government deficits via domestic borrowing and paying 1.2 million public sector salaries.  Key points from the article:
	•	Foreign reserves collapse:  Yemen’s foreign currency reserves fell from over US$6 billion in 2012 to US$2.1 billion by January 2016; about US$1 billion of the latter was a Saudi deposit maturing in 2017 .  Excluding that deposit, reserves would cover less than two months of imports .
	•	Currency stability:  Despite the conflict, the CBY kept the official exchange rate at YR 215 per US$1, while the black‑market rate hovered around YR 250 per US$1 (a 16 % difference) .  The bank restricted access to foreign currency, limited credit lines for importers and mandated that government transactions remain in riyals .
	•	Pressure from deregulated fuel imports:  Facing fuel shortages, the Houthis issued fuel import licences to private traders.  Black‑market fuel sold for 6,000 YR per 20 liters, more than double the YPC’s official price of 2,800 YR, yet it was constantly available .  Profits were so high that importers could purchase dollars at any exchange rate, putting further downward pressure on the riyal and depriving the state of taxes .

Humanitarian implications
	•	Risk of famine:  Yemen imports 90 % of its food, so currency stability is essential for purchasing basic commodities .  By early 2016, 21 million Yemenis (about 80 % of the population) needed humanitarian assistance .  If the CBY’s foreign reserves were exhausted, the riyal would collapse, public finances would implode and millions would face extreme hunger .
	•	Dwindling import capacity:  The CBY’s dwindling reserves meant it could no longer guarantee letters of credit for critical imports such as sugar, forcing importers to use the black market .  Any further devaluation would instantly increase the cost of food and fuel, exacerbating the humanitarian crisis.

Policy recommendations

The article argued that conflict cessation was the surest way to stabilise the economy but proposed interim measures for stakeholders:
	1.	Stop plundering state institutions:  Saudi Arabia, Iran and other backers should pressure their local allies to cease looting state revenues .
	2.	Re‑empower the YPC:  End the sale of private fuel licences and allow the YPC to resume regulated imports; introduce a temporary fuel tax to raise revenue and curb excessive consumption .
	3.	Restart limited oil exports:  Encourage SAFER Exploration & Production and foreign companies to resume safe, small‑scale exports to rebuild reserves, while ensuring revenues are not diverted to war spending .
	4.	Ease the blockade:  The Saudi‑led coalition should facilitate the flow of fuel and commodities through Yemeni ports and ensure distribution networks are protected from airstrikes .
	5.	Narrow public expenditures:  Prioritise payment of public sector salaries and minimum debt service; suspend non‑essential spending until revenues recover .
	6.	Allow currency transfers:  Permit commercial banks to exchange surplus Saudi riyals for US dollars to meet demand and facilitate imports .
	7.	Maintain CBY neutrality:  Keep the CBY independent of warring factions and support its efforts with foreign currency aid.  Options include allowing the CBY to access external accounts, direct purchases of Yemeni riyals by foreign donors or using aid programmes to inject riyals into the economy .

Significance

At the time of publication (February 2016), this report served as an urgent warning that Yemen’s economy was nearing free‑fall.  It highlighted the paradox that the country’s last functioning institution – the CBY – was simultaneously protecting the currency and financing the war through deficit spending.  The report foreshadowed the September 2016 relocation of the CBY to Aden and the subsequent split between rival central banks, which would later trigger a protracted currency war.  It also underlined the humanitarian stakes: maintaining the riyal’s value and state salaries was not merely an economic concern but a life‑saving necessity for millions of Yemenis.

Yemen Without a Functioning Central Bank (Nov 2016)

Executive context

This long report, released on November 2 2016 by the Sana’a Center, examined the consequences of the internationally recognized Yemeni government’s decision in September 2016 to relocate the Central Bank of Yemen (CBY) from Sana’a to Aden and replace its governor.  Written by Mansour Rageh and Farea al‑Muslimi, it argued that the relocation incapacitated the only institution capable of stabilising Yemen’s economy and that millions of Yemenis faced starvation if the CBY’s functions were not restored.  By October 2016 Yemen’s humanitarian crisis had been elevated to UN Level 3, placing it alongside Syria, Iraq and South Sudan .

The CBY’s essential roles before relocation

The report underscores how, despite years of upheaval and war, the CBY had continued to function nationwide:
	•	Macroeconomic management:  The CBY rolled over the last official budget (2014) into 2015 and 2016, effectively running macroeconomic policy after President Hadi fled .  Budget deficits of 4.6–8.3 % of GDP between 2009–2013 were financed through external loans, domestic bonds and CBY lending, leaving the government owing the CBY US$3.5 billion by December 2014 .
	•	Paying salaries and financing local councils:  The CBY facilitated a national revenue‑sharing system.  Local councils collected taxes and deposited them with local CBY branches; in return, the CBY disbursed operating funds for public sector salaries and services .  Even after Aden was retaken by Hadi’s forces, CBY headquarters in Sana’a chartered flights to deliver cash to Aden to cover budget allocations .
	•	Paying both sides:  The CBY continued to pay all Ministry of Defense employees registered in 2014, meaning soldiers fighting for both the Houthis and the internationally recognized government were receiving salaries from the same institution .  This favoured the Houthis, who had added thousands of militiamen to the payroll after seizing Sana’a .
	•	Preserving the Yemeni rial:  Yemen imports 90 % of its food, so protecting the currency’s value is vital.  The CBY maintained an official rate of YR 215 per US$ for years and intervened to limit parallel market trading .  After the coalition intervention, oil and gas exports halted, GDP contracted by ~30 % and the CBY spent US$1 billion to prop up the rial .  By October 2016 the black‑market rate had reached YR 310/US$, a 24 % difference from the official YR 250/US$ rate .
	•	Managing foreign reserves:  Foreign currency reserves peaked above US$6 billion in 2012 (bolstered by a US$1 billion Saudi deposit) .  They declined to US$2.8 billion by mid‑2015 and US$2.1 billion by January 2016 .  The CBY used these reserves to finance basic imports, focusing on wheat and rice; in the first half of 2016 it financed US$414 million in imports, almost 70 % of which went to wheat .
	•	Managing liquidity:  Yemen is a cash economy.  The CBY anticipated a liquidity crisis in mid‑2016 as public mistrust led individuals to withdraw money.  Between January and May 2016, 160 billion YER left the banking system, with another 140 billion YER withdrawn in June .  The government blocked the CBY from printing new notes in Russia, forcing the bank to re‑issue damaged banknotes that many businesses refused .

Scenarios and contingency planning

In January 2016, the CBY sent a confidential report to the government outlining three scenarios:
	1.	Continue supporting the rial and imports until reserves run out:  This would exhaust foreign currency reserves by September 2016, offering short‑term stability but risking default on foreign debt and loss of market confidence .
	2.	Reduce import financing:  Cutting lines of credit for fuel and sugar while continuing to finance wheat and rice could leave US$1 billion in reserves at year’s end .  Traders would have to buy dollars on the open market, putting downward pressure on the rial.
	3.	Float the currency and stop import financing:  This would preserve reserves but cause a rapid devaluation and commodity price spikes .

The CBY planned to pursue scenario 2 until reserves were depleted, then adopt scenario 3 .  Through the first half of 2016 the CBY spent about US$780 million in foreign currency, leaving it with roughly US$1.3 billion to begin the second half of the year .

Undermining and relocation of the CBY

The internationally recognized government gradually eroded the CBY’s neutrality:
	•	Oil receipts diverted:  When Mukalla port was liberated from Al‑Qaeda in June 2016, the proceeds from resumed oil exports were deposited in a new account at the Saudi National Bank instead of the CBY .
	•	Public accusations:  Prime Minister Ahmed Obaid bin Dagher accused Governor Mohammed Awad Bin Humam of misusing reserves and requested the IMF freeze the CBY’s accounts .  The government claimed the CBY had funnelled US$4 billion to the Houthis .  Western diplomats and financial institutions widely viewed these accusations as baseless, affirming Bin Humam’s technocratic neutrality .
	•	Freezing reserves:  International banks complied with the government’s request to deny the CBY access to foreign accounts, effectively imposing economic sanctions that severed the bank from its remaining foreign currency .
	•	Decree to relocate:  On September 18 2016, President Hadi decreed that the CBY headquarters be moved to Aden and that Bin Humam be replaced by Monasser al‑Quaiti .  The move was widely criticised as an attempt to weaponize the economy .  Hadi acknowledged that it could prevent payment of public servants’ salaries .
	•	Operational breakdown:  The new CBY in Aden lacked the 800 experienced staff, archives and expertise to function .  Security in Aden was poor; a car bomb hit the bank site.  Governor al‑Quaiti promised to resume core functions but offered no substantive plan, eroding confidence .  Even Saudi Arabia and the UAE delayed delivering promised funds .

Consequences for humanitarian crisis

The CBY’s incapacitation exacerbated Yemen’s humanitarian disaster:
	•	Malnutrition and displacement:  As of October 2016, 370,000 children suffered severe malnutrition and 1.5 million faced life‑threatening malnutrition .  More than 3 million people were displaced; 30 % of Yemenis faced severe food insecurity; four out of five needed assistance .  Ten governorates were on the brink of famine .
	•	Poverty:  The World Bank reported Yemen’s poverty rate doubled from 34 % in 2014 to 62 % by spring 2016 .
	•	Salaries and households:  Nearly 1.2 million civil servants (heads of households for roughly 6 million people) had not been paid since August 2016 .  The Social Welfare Fund, which supported the poorest, had stopped payments in December 2014 .
	•	Blockade and infrastructure:  The coalition blockade restricted commercial goods and aid .  Airstrikes destroyed ports, roads, and essential infrastructure, impeding humanitarian delivery .

Recommendations and outlook

The report insisted that ending the war is the surest way to mitigate the crisis.  Short of that, it called for:
	1.	Empowering the CBY irrespective of location:  Local, regional and international stakeholders must pressure the warring parties to respect the CBY’s neutrality and support its operations, whether in Sana’a or Aden .
	2.	Paying civil servants:  Immediate resumption of salary payments to prevent millions from falling into famine .
	3.	Restoring import credits:  Wheat importers said domestic supplies would be exhausted in two months without financing .  The CBY must extend lines of credit for basic fuel and food imports .
	4.	Supporting welfare programs:  Reinstate the Social Welfare Fund and stabilise the rial to alleviate the liquidity crisis .
	5.	Rescheduling debt:  Maintain or renegotiate foreign debt to preserve Yemen’s eligibility for future loans and aid .
	6.	Avoid weaponizing the economy:  The international community must prevent the use of starvation as a war tactic and encourage cooperation between staff in Sana’a and Aden .

The report warned that establishing separate central banks—either by the Houthis in Sana’a or the Hadi government in Aden—would deepen mistrust and push Yemen’s financial system toward collapse .  Cooperation between both sites was the only viable path to restore monetary stability .

Rapid Currency Depreciation and the Decimation of Yemeni Purchasing Power (March 31 2017)

Context and background

By early 2017 Yemen’s economy had entered free fall. The civil war and external intervention had halted oil exports (formerly the main source of foreign currency), devastated public revenues and disrupted government services.  In 2015–2016 the Central Bank of Yemen (CBY) operated from Sana’a and still managed to pay civil servants and provide import guarantees using dwindling foreign reserves.  A series of crises culminated in August 2016 when the CBY could no longer pay public-sector workers, creating a liquidity crisis .  The internationally recognised government (IRG) under President Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi relocated the bank to Aden in September 2016, severing the Sana’a branch from global financial networks and further limiting monetary control .  With no functioning central bank and rising inflation, the Yemeni rial (YR) slid from YR 215 per USD in 2014 to YR 320–330 by early February 2017 .  The country imports roughly 90 % of its food, so currency depreciation directly threatened food security .

Warnings of currency instability

Alex J. Harper’s analysis warns that the Yemeni rial risked rapid depreciation if external financial support was not provided.  During the two-year civil war, collapsing oil revenues, shrinking remittances and a severe liquidity crisis weakened the CBY’s ability to intervene in the foreign‐exchange market .  The CBY had previously stabilized the currency by selling USD to importers; after the relocation to Aden, the bank lost access to its foreign accounts and could not manage the exchange rate or pay salaries.  By early 2017 the rial was trading at YR 320–330 per USD, but speculation was building because the Aden government was about to release new rials printed in Russia and resume salary payments .  Market participants anticipated that 65 billion rials (the monthly salary bill) would be injected without adequate foreign reserves, prompting importers and households to convert savings into USD .  These expectations, combined with increased demand for foreign currency ahead of Ramadan, triggered a run on the rial: within days, its value plummeted to YR 400 per USD and some transactions reached YR 450 per USD .  The informal market developed two exchange rates—cash versus account transfers—because physical banknotes were scarce .

Factors mitigating depreciation

Despite these pressures, the rial did not collapse completely.  Foreign exchange inflows from international organisations and remittances continued, becoming the largest source of foreign currency .  Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates paid local forces in USD, injecting limited hard currency into the economy .  However, these flows were insufficient to stabilise the currency as the CBY’s reserves dwindled.

Emergency measures by rival authorities

When the rial plunged in February 2017, both the Sana’a‑based Government of National Salvation (GNS) and the Aden‑based IRG took emergency actions to stabilise it:
	•	Sana’a (GNS):  The CBY branch in Sana’a convened private banks and requested their assistance in supplying the market with foreign currency .  The GNS closed exchange offices, arrested traders accused of speculation and secured a 30‑day agreement with large importers to stop buying foreign currency on the open market .  This was reinforced when the Ministry of Telecommunications sold US$30 million to three major wheat importers at a preferential rate .  Importers relied on existing inventory to sell goods, leading to temporary shortages but reducing immediate demand for foreign exchange .
	•	Aden (IRG):  After beginning salary payments with the new banknotes, the IRG quickly halted distribution to prevent further depreciation .  CBY governor Monasser al‑Quaiti met with exchange companies and assured them that foreign support was forthcoming .  In late February, President Hadi travelled to Riyadh and announced that Saudi Arabia would provide US$10 billion, including $2 billion for currency stabilization and $8 billion for reconstruction .  While the funds were not immediately delivered, the announcement helped calm markets.

These measures succeeded in temporarily stabilising the rial around YR 340 per USD by mid‑February .  The GNS’s commitment to continue offering importers a favourable exchange rate kept traders off the open market, preventing another run.

Continued vulnerability and warnings

Despite the February reprieve, the article warned that Yemen was still on the cusp of rapid depreciation.  It reported that the Sana’a CBY held only US$100 million and 200 million Saudi Riyals in cash reserves .  The Aden CBY theoretically had US$700 million in foreign accounts but could not access them because it was not connected to the SWIFT international payment system .  Economists noted that the only way the Sana’a CBY could support the rial was by selling its reserves directly to importers, which could sustain currency demand for only six to eight weeks .  The Houthis were pressing the bank to use these reserves to pay public‑sector salaries, but the CBY resisted because the money belonged to private banks .

Without the promised Saudi deposit or other robust financial intervention, analysts predicted the rial would soon enter another phase of rapid depreciation .  From mid‑February to late March the rial gradually slipped from YR 340 to YR 355 per USD, indicating underlying weakness .

Implications for famine and humanitarian crisis

The article linked monetary collapse directly to Yemen’s humanitarian emergency.  Yemen depends on imports for about 90 % of its nutritional needs, so depreciation would immediately raise food prices.  Even before the salary suspension, the World Bank estimated that poverty increased from 34 % in 2014 to 62 % by early 2016 .  After 1.2 million public‑sector workers lost wages in August 2016, poverty undoubtedly worsened .  The Saudi‑led coalition’s blockade and internal distribution problems further restricted food supplies .  The Food and Agriculture Organization declared Yemen “the largest food security emergency in the world” in February 2017 , and the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs reported that 18.8 million people needed assistance, of whom 10.3 million were acutely affected and 3.3 million (including 2.1 million children) were acutely malnourished .  Any further currency decline would drastically reduce households’ purchasing power, accelerating famine .

Takeaways and insights
	1.	Central bank dysfunction is central to economic collapse:  The relocation of the CBY to Aden severed the bank from SWIFT and triggered a split in monetary management.  Both the Sana’a and Aden branches lack capacity to intervene effectively or coordinate policy.  Until a unified and internationally connected central bank is restored, currency stability will remain fragile.
	2.	Confidence is easily lost:  Market participants responded quickly to rumors of new money supply and the absence of foreign reserves.  Announcements of large foreign deposits (e.g., the Saudi $2 billion) can temporarily stabilise expectations, even without immediate disbursement.
	3.	Foreign reserves are critical:  The Sana’a CBY had only enough reserves to support the currency for 6–8 weeks .  The Aden CBY’s reserves were inaccessible, showing that physical holdings alone are meaningless without international access.
	4.	Humanitarian impacts are direct and severe:  Currency depreciation amplifies poverty and hunger because Yemen imports most of its food.  Rapid rial losses translate into immediate price spikes; with half the population already food insecure, any further shock could tip millions into famine.
	5.	Political pressure shapes monetary policy:  Both sides – the GNS/Houthi authorities and the IRG – used emergency measures (closing exchanges, halting salaries) driven by political imperatives, such as paying loyal forces or avoiding public unrest.  These actions may stabilise the currency temporarily but do not address underlying structural weaknesses.

Stakeholders and key developments (accumulated log)

Stakeholder / Actor	Role & Influence (2016–2017)	Relevance in this article
Central Bank of Yemen (CBY)	State institution responsible for monetary policy. Split into Sana’a-based branch under Houthi control and Aden-based branch under IRG. Relocation to Aden cut off the bank from SWIFT and reduced capacity to intervene; liquidity crisis ensued .	Both branches attempted to stabilise the rial: Sana’a CBY coordinated with banks, closed exchangers and offered preferential rates ; Aden CBY halted salary distributions and sought foreign assistance .
Government of National Salvation (GNS)	Houthi–Saleh administration controlling Sana’a and northern areas. Manages Sana’a CBY and implements policies to stabilise currency.	Ordered currency traders to cease operations; arrested speculators; brokered agreement with importers to stop buying foreign currency; sold US$30 million to wheat importers at preferential rate .
Internationally Recognised Government (IRG)	Hadi-led government based in Aden. Controls Aden CBY and has limited authority over monetary policy and public finances.	Initiated salary payments with newly printed rials, then halted them to stop currency collapse; sought Saudi financial aid; promised foreign currency support through meetings with exchange firms .
Monasser al‑Quaiti	CBY governor (Aden branch).	Met with exchange companies to discuss stabilization; emphasised impending foreign support .
Importers and Private Banks	Major importers (wheat, fuel) and banks hold key foreign exchange; coordinate with authorities to manage currency supply.	In Sana’a, major importers agreed to stop buying foreign currency for 30 days ; this measure was crucial to stabilise the currency.
Saudi Arabia and UAE	Coalition partners supporting IRG; major source of foreign currency through payments and promised aid.	Saudi leadership pledged US$10 billion to Yemen, including $2 billion for currency stabilization .  Also pay local forces in hard currency, providing inflows that mitigate depreciation .
FAO, OCHA, World Bank	International organisations monitoring humanitarian and economic indicators.	FAO declared Yemen the largest food security emergency (Feb 2017); OCHA reported 18.8 million people needing aid and 3.3 million acutely malnourished ; the World Bank noted poverty rising from 34 % to 62 % by early 2016 . These references underscore the humanitarian danger of currency depreciation.

How Currency Arbitrage Has Reduced the Funds Available to Address the Humanitarian Crisis (Sept 6 2017)

Context and overview

By September 2017, Yemen had been at war for more than two years.  The Central Bank of Yemen (CBY) had split between rival governments in Sana’a (controlled by the Houthi–Saleh alliance’s Government of National Salvation, GNS) and Aden (internationally recognised government, IRG) after its relocation in late 2016.  The economy collapsed; oil exports halted; foreign reserves dwindled; and the Yemeni rial plunged on the parallel market while the official exchange rate remained fixed at YR 250 per USD .  Humanitarian agencies responded by shifting from in‑kind assistance to cash transfers in mid‑2016 because local markets were still able to provide goods, and cash transfers offered flexibility and multiplier effects  .  Donors exchanged USD at the official rate through Yemeni banks, then distributed rials to beneficiaries.

The article reveals that the growing gap between the official and market exchange rates created lucrative currency‑arbitrage opportunities for banks and exchange houses.  By mid‑2017, banks were reselling humanitarian funds at market rates, profiting from the difference, while aid organisations’ purchasing power declined.

The exchange-rate gap and currency arbitrage

Before the conflict there was little difference between official and market exchange rates: the CBY maintained a managed float around YR 214.9 per USD .  As the war escalated and oil exports were suspended, the CBY’s foreign reserves dwindled and downward pressure on the rial intensified .  By the second quarter of 2016, the market rate had fallen to YR 280 per USD, 30 % lower than the official rate .  The CBY devalued the official rate to YR 250 per USD but market depreciation continued.  When the bank was relocated to Aden without transferring expertise or reserves, its capacity to supervise currency markets collapsed .  By July 2017 the parallel market rate reached YR 367 per USD, representing a total loss of 70 % of the rial’s value since the conflict began and 47 % lower than the official rate .

Humanitarian organisations continued to convert their USD at the official rate (YR 250), reluctant to conduct transactions outside the formal system .  Meanwhile, most Yemeni banks and money exchangers already operated at market rates, so they profited by exchanging donors’ USD at the official rate and then selling the rials on the parallel market .  The article cites Sana’a Center financial sources indicating that one major Yemeni bank earned almost US$80 million in profits between January and August 2017 from such arbitrage .  In effect, humanitarian funds intended for vulnerable Yemenis were diverted to bank profits.

Impact on humanitarian assistance

The disparity severely eroded the reach of cash‑transfer programmes.  The Food Security and Agriculture Cluster priced a standard monthly food basket at YR 24,000 per family .  Exchanging USD at the official rate, the basket cost US$96, whereas at the July 2017 market rate (YR 367 per USD) it cost only US$65.40 .  Assuming 1.9 million beneficiaries received cash transfers at the official rate, the same funds exchanged at the market rate could have assisted almost 2.8 million people .  This loss of capacity occurred amid severe funding shortfalls; the World Food Programme warned that a 65 % funding level would force it to cut off 3 million severely food‑insecure people from general food assistance .  The article also notes that banks’ arbitrage profits were largely used for wealth accumulation rather than financing essential imports .

CBY policy shift: floating the rial

On August 14 2017, the CBY in Aden announced that it would float the value of the rial, linking the official rate to the market .  According to Sana’a Center sources, the decision resulted from World Bank pressure and negotiations between UNICEF and banks in Sana’a regarding the exchange rate, preparing for nearly US$400 million in new humanitarian aid from the World Bank to UNICEF and the United Nations Development Programme .  The first US$50 million tranche, exchanged at the market rate, was expected to reach 1.5 million beneficiaries across six governorates .  However, the Houthis in northern Yemen refused to recognise the new CBY governor and maintained tariffs at the fixed rate of YR 250 per USD, while continuing to collect customs revenues at Hudaydah port .  This created a dual exchange‑rate environment: market rate in government areas vs. fixed rate in Houthi areas, complicating monetary management and trade.

Recommendations and policy options

The article argues that neither the fixed rate nor a fully floating currency is ideal under current conditions.  A full float might trigger rapid devaluation because the CBY is divided, lacks reserves and cannot intervene effectively .  Instead, the Sana’a Center recommends:
	1.	Dedicated aid exchange rate – Calculate a special exchange rate for humanitarian funds using the moving average of the market rate over the previous three months; if the difference between the aid rate and the market rate exceeds 10 %, the rate should be re‑evaluated .
	2.	Monitoring and transparency – The CBY and humanitarian actors should develop monitoring and reporting mechanisms, declaring daily market and aid exchange rates and reporting all humanitarian fund exchanges to the central bank .
	3.	Coordination with banks – Increase coordination between the CBY and local banks to ensure that foreign currency from aid flows is used to import essential goods rather than fuel speculative profits .

Humanitarian context and references

The article situates currency arbitrage within Yemen’s broader humanitarian emergency.  FAO declared Yemen “the world’s largest humanitarian crisis” in February 2017 (cited in notes), and by July 2017 the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) reported that 20.7 million Yemenis needed some form of assistance, up from 18.8 million in January; 17 million were food insecure (6.8 million severely so), while 8 million lacked clean water .  Yemen’s GDP had contracted 37 % between 2014 and 2016 .  Roughly 1.2 million civil servants, supporting about 7 million people, had not been paid since September 2016 .  Public service breakdowns (healthcare, water, garbage collection) contributed to a cholera epidemic with 500,000 suspected cases and more than 2,000 deaths by mid‑August 2017 .  Aid appeals were severely underfunded: the UN’s $1.63 billion appeal for 2016 was only 60 % funded, and the updated $2.3 billion appeal for 2017 was only 41.7 % funded by September .

Takeaways and insights
	1.	Currency arbitrage siphons humanitarian funds:  Because aid agencies exchanged money at the official rate while banks operated at market rates, a significant share of aid was captured by private banks.  This reduced the number of beneficiaries and undermined food security at a time when millions faced hunger.
	2.	Dual exchange rates fuel fragmentation:  The divergence between official and parallel rates created incentives for speculation and strengthened the black market.  Floating the rial may help align rates, but without unified monetary governance it risks volatility.
	3.	Need for a special aid rate:  The proposed moving‑average aid rate aims to protect the value of humanitarian funds, stabilise prices and prevent speculative profits.  Its adoption requires coordination between CBY branches, banks and aid agencies.
	4.	Humanitarian urgency:  The article underscores that currency policies have immediate human consequences in Yemen.  The difference between exchange rates could mean life or death for hundreds of thousands of people, as aid resources become scarce and the economy contracts.
	5.	Political implications:  The Houthis’ refusal to adopt the new CBY policies and their continued tariffs at a fixed rate illustrate how monetary issues are entangled with territorial control and revenue collection.  Without political reconciliation and a unified central bank, technical monetary reforms will have limited impact.

Renewed Rapid Currency Depreciation and Diverging Monetary Policy Between Sana’a and Aden (Oct 31 2017)

Summary and context

In October 2017, the Yemeni rial (YR) suffered its second major crash of the year.  After losing about 20 % of its value in February (covered in the previous analysis), the currency dropped almost 10 % between late September and mid‑October, falling from about YR 375 per USD to YR 412 .  This sharp depreciation reflected more than two‑and‑a‑half years of civil war, regional intervention and the destruction of Yemen’s economic base.  Yemen’s gross domestic product had already shrunk 37 % between 2014 and 2016, while oil exports – formerly the main source of foreign currency – remained suspended .  The Central Bank of Yemen (CBY) was split between rival administrations after President Hadi relocated its headquarters to Aden in September 2016, undermining monetary control and causing severe shortages of banknotes .

The October currency slide was triggered by a combination of increased supply of rials and decreased demand.  After the Eid al‑Adha holiday, remittances (a key source of foreign currency) declined .  In Sana’a, authorities had been paying civil servants with vouchers, financed by digitally creating about YR 45 billion.  When businesses redeemed these vouchers, they flooded the market with rials to buy foreign currency for restocking .  Meanwhile, the internationally recognised government in Aden announced it would regularly pay public sector salaries across southern governorates (roughly YR 20 billion monthly) and began distributing newly printed banknotes on September 29 .  This injection of cash occurred without any increase in revenue or foreign reserves .  The combined effect was a surge in rial supply and falling demand, pushing the currency down .

Diverging responses and the risk of dual monetary systems

Authorities in Sana’a (Houthi–Saleh alliance)

To arrest the rial’s slide, Houthi‑Saleh security services in Sana’a began mass arrests of currency exchangers and speculators .  Deputy Prime Minister Hussein Maqbouli convened a meeting with the National Security Council, the General People’s Congress, banks, currency traders and major importers (notably without the CBY’s participation) .  The resulting six‑point action plan included:
	1.	Coordinated foreign‑currency sales – Bank and importer committees would schedule the sale of foreign currency through CAC Bank, Yemen’s largest public bank.  Fuel importers pledged to deposit YR 6 billion into CAC Bank to purchase foreign currency wholesale .
	2.	Currency controls – Prohibited foreign currency from leaving Houthi‑controlled areas without CBY approval and banned large transfers of rials from southern Yemen, capping each transaction at YR 5 million .
	3.	Collective restraint – Banks, importers, telecom companies and traders committed to not buying foreign currency on the market until at least the end of October .
	4.	Enforcement – Security services would pursue and punish violators of these provisions .

According to Sana’a Center sources, the authorities planned to go further by announcing a fixed exchange rate below market value and forcing money exchangers to adhere to it .  While framed as anti‑speculation, this would formalise separate monetary policy in northern Yemen and risk massive currency smuggling.  As remittances shift toward Marib and Aden to secure better rates, large‑scale smuggling would likely develop to circumvent controls .  Marib, already an economic hub due to business relocation from Sana’a, would gain more influence and strengthen its political aspirations .

Authorities in Aden (internationally recognised government)

In Aden, Prime Minister Ahmed Obeid bin Daghr held meetings with CBY officials and private bank directors.  Measures included prohibiting large transfers of foreign and domestic currency to northern Yemen and closing unlicensed currency exchanges .  The government pledged to continue importing fuel for electricity generation, partially covering market needs .  These actions aimed to limit currency outflows and curb speculation.  Nevertheless, by late October the rial was trading between YR 406 and YR 412 per USD, while many businesses priced goods at YR 500 per USD in anticipation of further depreciation .

Implications of divergent monetary policies

The article warns that different exchange‑rate regimes in the north and south could lead to “one currency with two monetary policies.”  Such a situation would deepen the institutional schism of the CBY and accelerate Yemen’s fragmentation into distinct economic areas .  A fixed rate in Sana’a would drive remittances and currency flows to the south, incentivise smuggling and empower black‑market exchangers and tribal networks .  Trust in the formal banking sector has already eroded, with financial clout shifting to semi‑official and black‑market exchangers .  Separate policies would thus undermine any remaining confidence and distort market mechanisms .  The authors caution that flooding the market with rials, raising salaries without new revenue and imposing currency controls could trigger rapid inflation and hyperinflation, devastating millions of Yemenis .  They call on both sides to avoid these actions and to coordinate rather than compete.

Takeaways and insights
	1.	Liquidity injections without revenue spur depreciation:  Paying salaries and issuing vouchers financed by printing money depresses the rial’s value when there are no accompanying increases in foreign currency reserves or government income.
	2.	Stop‑gap measures provide only temporary relief:  Both the Sana’a and Aden authorities have repeatedly resorted to closing exchanges, halting salary payments and negotiating with importers.  These actions stabilised the currency in February but did not address underlying structural weaknesses.
	3.	Two monetary policies risk formalising Yemen’s division:  A fixed rate in the north and a floating rate in the south would encourage currency arbitrage and smuggling, further weakening state control and enabling the rise of regional power centres like Marib.
	4.	Political solutions are necessary for monetary stability:  The article underscores that monetary policy cannot be disentangled from the broader conflict.  Only a unified central bank and coordinated economic governance can prevent hyperinflation and restore confidence.

Restoring Central Bank Capacity and Stabilizing the Rial (Feb 8 2018)

Context and rationale

By early 2018, the Yemeni rial had deteriorated dramatically: it traded around YR 530 per USD in mid‑January 2018, compared with YR 215 per USD before the conflict .  This collapse was a major driver of Yemen’s food insecurity, as millions of people could no longer afford to buy food.  Recognizing that a functioning and unified Central Bank of Yemen (CBY) is essential for economic stability, the “Rethinking Yemen’s Economy” initiative convened more than 20 Yemeni economic experts at the Development Champions Forum in Amman (January 14–16, 2018).  They identified currency depreciation and central bank fragmentation as urgent issues and drafted this policy brief to provide practical recommendations for re‑empowering the CBY and stabilising the rial.  Saudi Arabia’s announcement on January 17 of a US$2 billion deposit to the CBY reinforced the need for coordinated deployment of foreign reserves .

Key problems identified
	•	Fragmented monetary authority: After President Hadi relocated the CBY to Aden in September 2016, the bank split into rival branches that could not coordinate monetary policy.  Leadership remained abroad (Amman and Riyadh), making effective management impossible .
	•	Loss of foreign currency access: Yemeni commercial banks struggled to transfer foreign currency abroad due to the closure of Sana’a airport and foreign banks closing accounts over compliance concerns .
	•	Severe liquidity and currency depreciation: The rial’s value plunged to YR 530 per USD, cutting purchasing power.  The CBY printed money to relieve liquidity shortages, but this risked further depreciation .
	•	Lack of transparency and public trust: CBY leadership operated from abroad; little information on liquidity and bank balance sheets was shared, undermining confidence .

Recommendations to the Central Bank of Yemen (CBY)
	1.	Fulfil legal mandate (Law 14 of 2000): Manage all government foreign currency accounts and abide by CBY Law 14 and its amendments .  This would ensure that revenues and reserves are properly managed under central authority.
	2.	Regulate currency printing: Carefully balance printing new rials to ease the liquidity crisis against the risk of further depreciation; use per‑capita purchasing power relative to basic commodities as a guiding metric .
	3.	Coordinate deployment of the US$2 billion deposit: Establish coordination mechanisms with Yemeni banks, money exchangers and large private sector actors to maximise the stabilising impact of the deposit and support essential imports .
	4.	Curb market manipulation: Enact policies and legal procedures with banks and large firms to reduce currency market manipulation; punish violators with sanctions .
	5.	Pay interest on treasury bills: Resume paying interest to commercial banks on government treasury bills to inject liquidity and encourage banks to offer interest on deposits.  This would rebuild customer trust and stimulate savings .
	6.	Relocate CBY leadership to Yemen: Senior management must return to Aden to effectively manage the bank; remote leadership from Amman or Riyadh is inadequate .
	7.	Enhance transparency: Publish monthly, quarterly and annual reports, including balance sheets and liquidity data, to domestic and international stakeholders .
	8.	Re‑activate the Financial Information Unit (FIU): The FIU, responsible for anti‑money‑laundering and counter‑terrorism financing oversight, should resume operations and coordinate with MENAFATF to reduce compliance risks that led foreign banks to close Yemeni accounts .

Recommendations to the Government of Yemen (GoY)
	1.	Centralise foreign currency accounts: Deposit all government foreign currency revenues into CBY accounts as required by law; cease maintaining separate accounts abroad (e.g., at Ahli Bank in Saudi Arabia) .
	2.	Improve revenue collection and anti‑corruption: Enhance mechanisms for taxes, customs and oil/gas revenues; deposit funds into CBY accounts; share the national budget and economic data with Parliament .
	3.	Avoid inflationary financing: Do not print new rials to cover expenditures; increase the use of cheques rather than cash in state revenue collection to reduce liquidity shortages and corruption .
	4.	Re‑activate anti‑money‑laundering committee: Restart the National Committee to Combat Money Laundering and Terrorism Financing .
	5.	Establish an advisory team on fiscal and economic policy: Include representatives from state institutions, economists and sectoral experts; provide counsel on socioeconomic matters to the government and regional/international stakeholders .
	6.	Increase oil and gas production: Strive to restore hydrocarbon output to pre‑conflict levels; engage Saudi authorities to reduce taxes on Yemeni diaspora workers, thereby increasing remittances .

Recommendations to the Saudi‑led coalition & international community
	1.	Provide additional foreign currency deposits: Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states should deposit more funds into the CBY to stabilise the rial, fund imports and restore basic services .
	2.	Facilitate trade finance: Assist Yemeni banks in securing trade finance for essential commodity imports; allow flights to transport foreign currency banknotes to Yemeni banks’ accounts in Bahrain .
	3.	Accelerate the Trade Finance Facility for Food Imports: Urge the World Bank Group to implement this facility announced in April 2017 .
	4.	Provide technical support and capacity building: Offer training, advisers and IT systems to help the CBY manage budgets, transactions and operations .
	5.	Improve oversight of oil import clearances: Coalition members controlling Red Sea ports should require proper payment documentation for oil shipments to reduce currency market manipulation and deter illicit imports .

Development Champions & collaborative initiative

The policy brief was produced by the Sana’a Center, DeepRoot Consulting and CARPO, funded by the European Union and the Netherlands.  It lists 20+ Yemeni development champions—including government officials, academics, business leaders, and civil society representatives (e.g., Jeehan Abdulghaffar, Dr. Asmahan Alalas, Omar Al‑Aqel, Badr Basalmah, Dr. Saadaldeen Talib, Dr. Souad Othman Yafeai)—underscoring the broad consensus behind the recommendations .  The document clarifies that these recommendations represent personal opinions, not official positions of the donors .

Takeaways and insights
	1.	Unified monetary authority is indispensable: Without a single central bank controlling foreign reserves and currency issuance, Yemen cannot stabilise its currency.  Reunification of the CBY and relocation of leadership back to Yemen are key.
	2.	Foreign deposits offer temporary relief, not a solution: The $2 billion Saudi deposit may buy time, but long‑term stability requires institutional reforms, transparent management and improved revenue collection.
	3.	Transparency rebuilds trust: Publishing regular reports and resuming anti‑money‑laundering oversight would help restore confidence among local banks, foreign correspondents and the public.
	4.	Coordination with private sector is crucial: Stabilising the rial and managing the liquidity crisis demands cooperation between the CBY, banks, money exchangers and large importers to ensure foreign currency is used to import necessities, not fuel speculation.
	5.	International actors must support trade finance: Lifting restrictions on Yemeni banks and enabling trade finance is essential to avoid supply bottlenecks and reduce reliance on informal networks.

Famine at Hand Without a Reunified Central Bank to Protect the Yemeni Rial (Oct 16 2018)

Context and key message

This short editorial, published in The Yemen Review in October 2018, highlights that the greatest threat facing Yemenis is not direct violence but the collapse of the Yemeni rial, which is driving mass famine.  By late September 2018 the rial had lost three‑quarters of its pre‑war value, sliding from YR 215 per USD (March 2015) to YR 760 per USD .  The currency’s decline accelerated over August–September, dropping 40 % in those two months alone .  This depreciation led to skyrocketing prices and a nationwide fuel crisis, leaving millions unable to afford food despite adequate supply .  The editorial warns that Yemen’s humanitarian crisis is fundamentally an economic crisis caused by deliberate policy choices, particularly the decision to split the central bank and print money.

Why the crisis is man‑made
	1.	Central bank division:  The internationally recognised government moved the CBY headquarters from Sana’a to Aden in September 2016.  This created two central banks operating independently on opposite sides of the war, rendering neither capable of effectively managing the currency or economy .  The editorial argues that reunifying the CBY is the most urgent step to protect the rial and should be the core of UN envoy Martin Griffiths’s economic de‑escalation efforts .
	2.	Insufficient financial support:  Gulf states promised deposits but delivered insufficient or poorly conditioned funding.  While Saudi Arabia deposited US$2 billion in early 2018, Riyadh’s conditions on how the funds could be used and the Aden CBY’s own restrictions limited their impact .  Former CBY governor Mohammed bin Hummam told the Sana’a Center that even this amount was likely inadequate .  The editorial notes that Bahrain received US$10 billion in support and Turkey US$15 billion from regional partners to stabilise their currencies, illustrating that far smaller sums could prevent famine in Yemen .
	3.	Remittance clampdown:  Saudi Arabia’s labour nationalisation campaign has expelled thousands of Yemeni expatriate workers, reducing remittances—Yemen’s largest source of foreign currency since oil and gas exports stopped in March 2015 .  The editorial urges Riyadh to halt expulsions to maintain this lifeline.
	4.	Money printing and corruption:  The Yemeni government continues to pay civil servant salaries by ordering the Aden CBY to print new banknotes, expanding the money supply and further depreciating the rial .  The editorial calls on authorities to stop printing money and instead focus on restoring oil and gas production, the previous source of revenue .  It also demands that the newly appointed Prime Minister Maeen Abdulmalik activate transparency mechanisms, address corruption allegations and curb lavish spending .
	5.	Limited influence of the Aden CBY:  The Aden CBY announced plans to speed up import financing and collaborate with banks and exchangers to stabilise the rial .  However, the largest banks and financial players are based in Sana’a, limiting the Aden CBY’s reach .  Thus, without reunification, policies from Aden alone will be ineffective.

Proposed solutions
	•	Reunify the Central Bank:  Multilateral pressure must compel both the Yemeni government and the armed Houthi movement to reunify the CBY and allow it to operate independently of the belligerents .
	•	Provide substantial financial support:  Gulf countries should offer more generous and less restrictive deposits.  The editorial notes that only a fraction of the funds provided to Bahrain and Turkey would be sufficient to stabilise Yemen’s economy and avert famine .
	•	Cease expulsions of Yemeni workers:  Saudi Arabia should stop deporting Yemeni expatriates and consider easing taxes and fees on them to preserve remittances .
	•	Stop printing currency and restore hydrocarbon production:  The Yemeni government must halt inflationary financing and focus on reviving oil and gas exports .
	•	Enhance transparency and curb corruption:  Prime Minister Maeen Abdulmalik should implement transparency mechanisms, investigate corruption allegations and cut excessive spending .
	•	Integrate import financing:  Plans to regulate the currency market by speeding up trader qualification and collaborating with banks must be paired with CBY reunification to be effective .

Takeaways and insights
	1.	Currency collapse, not war alone, drives famine:  The article emphasises that famine is primarily due to the currency’s collapse, which is a consequence of policy choices, not an inevitable outcome of war.  Stabilising the rial is therefore central to saving lives.
	2.	Political will matters:  Reunifying the CBY and providing financial support are achievable if parties and their backers prioritise humanitarian needs over political goals.  The editorial asserts that failing to act makes them responsible for mass starvation .
	3.	Remittances are vital:  Expulsion of Yemeni workers from Saudi Arabia undermines the primary source of foreign currency; reversing this policy could ease the currency crisis.
	4.	Inflationary spending exacerbates crisis:  Printing new money to pay salaries without revenue backing accelerates depreciation; restoring oil and gas exports and curbing corruption offer more sustainable solutions.
	5.	Limited authority of Aden CBY:  Without reunification, the Aden-based CBY’s attempts to regulate the currency and provide import financing will remain ineffective because it lacks control over the majority of financial institutions .

	•	Concepts added – Importance of remittances, Gulf economic aid comparisons (Bahrain and Turkey), and linking humanitarian crisis to currency collapse.
	•	Continuity – This editorial builds on earlier warnings about currency depreciation and the need for a unified central bank.

This concise editorial underscores the critical connection between Yemen’s monetary policy and its humanitarian crisis.  It calls for urgent political and economic action to prevent mass famine and will inform our understanding of subsequent developments.

Article 9 – Revitalizing Yemen’s Banking Sector: Necessary Steps for Restarting Formal Financial Cycles and Basic Economic Stabilization (February 2019)

Context and Purpose

By early 2019, Yemen’s banking system was on the verge of collapse.  The ongoing civil war had not only divided control of the country but also split the central bank itself.  President Hadi’s September 2016 decision to move the Central Bank of Yemen (CBY) headquarters from Houthi‑controlled Sana’a to interim capital Aden created two rival central banks with competing jurisdictions, staffs and policy preferences .  Both branches lacked the capacity to perform core functions; Sana’a retained the bulk of trained staff and financial archives yet no longer had foreign reserves or international recognition , while Aden held international recognition but lacked institutional memory and technical expertise .  This report—authored by Farea al‑Muslimi for the Development Champions Forum—diagnoses the structural problems plaguing Yemen’s banks and proposes a roadmap for restoring formal financial cycles.

Key Challenges Facing Yemen’s Banks

Prolonged liquidity crisis and loss of public confidence

• Economic collapse and depleted reserves:  After oil exports halted in 2015—the government’s primary revenue source—Yemen entered a precipitous decline in economic activity .  To fund public spending, the CBY drew down domestic currency reserves and used foreign reserves to finance imports .  The bank sought to preserve foreign exchange by limiting local access, and commercial banks limited withdrawals .

• Run on banks:  These policies, combined with a coalition‑imposed financial blockade, spooked depositors.  In the first six months of 2016, customers withdrew roughly YR300 billion (~US$1.2 billion) from their accounts, sending huge sums into the informal cash economy .  Without liquidity, commercial banks could not deposit funds at the CBY.  The Sana’a‑based CBY began re‑issuing damaged notes and eventually suspended salary payments to 1.2 million public employees in September 2016 because there was not enough physical cash .  Foreign reserves were also nearly exhausted .

A divided central bank

• Dual administrations:  The Aden branch lacked staff, archives and institutional capacity; the Sana’a branch retained personnel but had no reserves or external recognition .  The split created divergent monetary policies that hindered efforts to manage liquidity and undermined confidence in formal banking.  The two banks occasionally issued conflicting regulations, and commercial banks struggled to navigate the competing mandates.

• Frozen assets and public debt:  Funds deposited before September 2016 became stuck in limbo.  Both central banks restricted cash withdrawals to deposits made after the split; pre‑split balances could only be used to transfer balances within the system .  Public debt repayments were suspended; banks’ treasury bills and Islamic sukuk matured but were converted into uncashable accounts .  The Aden CBY later raised interest rates and issued new debt instruments, but required banks to purchase them in cash—effectively preventing the reallocation of existing balances .

Deterioration of the Yemeni rial

• Currency collapse:  The report notes that by late 2018 the rial had lost almost two‑thirds of its value since March 2015, plunging from YR215 per US$1 to a low above YR800 per US$1 in October 2018 .  Rapid devaluations prompted savers to withdraw rials and convert them into dollars or Saudi riyals on the black market , further draining liquidity from banks.  Banks with greater foreign currency liabilities suffered losses, whereas some with reserves speculated on exchange rates .

Competing financial and monetary control

• Rival import financing schemes:  To restore formal trade flows, the Aden CBY developed a framework using a $2 billion Saudi deposit to finance five essential commodities (rice, wheat, milk, sugar and cooking oil).  Decree 75 (September 2018) attempted to regulate fuel and commodity imports .  However, disputes between the central banks prevented banks from fully utilizing this framework .

• Houthi vs. Aden directives:  The Aden CBY required letters of credit to be opened in Aden and funded with cash deposits, but Houthi authorities ordered banks to use checks to guarantee imports .  Houthi authorities threatened bank executives with imprisonment for complying with Aden’s directives and even detained senior staff at Tadhamon International Islamic Bank and al‑Kuraimi Microfinance Bank .  This climate of coercion undermined trust and prompted banks to rely on informal cash networks.

• Restrictions on cash movement and new banknotes:  In December 2018, Houthi authorities capped cash transfers out of their territory at YR450,000 (≈US$900), forcing banks to use risky and expensive smuggling routes .  They also tried to block the circulation of new banknotes printed in Aden, contributing to a liquidity shortage; more than 90 % of the old banknotes were deemed damaged .  Banknote circulation outside the formal banking sector more than doubled between 2014 and 2017—from YR810.9 billion to YR1.67 trillion—and most of the population in Houthi‑held areas continued to rely on cash .

• SWIFT and correspondent banking:  International banking restrictions exacerbated the crisis.  After the CBY split, the SWIFT network was deactivated in September 2016 and only reinstated in April 2017.  Even after reactivation, foreign currency reserves were depleted and international banks refused to interact with Yemeni institutions .  The Aden CBY has resumed SWIFT operations but cannot fully ease restrictions because Yemen fails to meet global anti‑money‑laundering standards .  Furthermore, the Saudi‑led coalition’s limits on foreign currency transfers prevent banks from using their own hard currency reserves to finance imports .

Recommendations for Revitalization

The policy brief proposes a multi‑faceted strategy, highlighting that reunifying the CBY is the most urgent priority.  It stresses that the UN and international community should pressure all parties to facilitate reunification and threaten sanctions against spoilers .  Other recommendations include:
	1.	Reactivate anti‑money‑laundering and counter‑terrorism financing mechanisms:  The CBY’s Financial Information Unit and Yemen’s national AML committee should be restored and neutral, facilitating information exchange with global partners .
	2.	Release banks’ retained balances:  Re‑activate the central bank’s clearing house so banks can use their frozen pre‑2016 deposits to meet urgent customer needs and pay government dues .  The Aden CBY should release banks’ foreign currency balances and facilitate transfers abroad to finance imports .
	3.	Facilitate secure transfers of cash holdings:  Establish safe channels (including UN‑escorted flights) for moving domestic and foreign currency between Sana’a and Aden .  Implement the November 2018 agreement with the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency to move foreign currency out of Yemen .
	4.	Ease import financing requirements and create a cash‑clearing system:  Allow banks to use a defined share of their frozen balances to underwrite letters of credit for essential imports and set up a cash‑clearing system to reduce the costs of moving banknotes across frontlines .
	5.	Replace damaged banknotes:  Replace old, damaged rial notes and mediate between the rival CBYs to ensure new notes circulate throughout Yemen .
	6.	Restart partial servicing of public debt:  Begin cash payments on accrued interest to commercial and Islamic banks and eventually pay down principal once fiscal conditions improve .

Takeaways and Insights
	•	This 2019 policy brief shows that Yemen’s banking collapse was not inevitable—it resulted from political decisions (central bank relocation, conflicting regulations, and weaponisation of currency) interacting with economic shocks.  The mass withdrawal of deposits, the inability to print or distribute cash, and the divergence of monetary policies eroded trust and forced Yemenis into informal markets.
	•	The report underscores that without a unified, competent central bank, technical fixes—such as import financing mechanisms—cannot function.  Rival authorities not only issue inconsistent rules but also intimidate bank staff, exacerbating risk.  Reconstruction of Yemen’s economy thus hinges on resolving the political stalemate.
	•	Importantly, the policy brief recognises that external factors contribute to the crisis.  International sanctions, correspondent banking restrictions and coalition limits on foreign currency transfers hinder banks from performing basic functions.  Reintegrating Yemen into the global financial system will require both domestic reforms and external support.

Article 10 – Yemen Economic Bulletin: The War for Monetary Control Enters a Dangerous New Phase (January 21 2020)

Context and Purpose

By early 2020 Yemen’s currency war had escalated into a full‑blown battle between two central banks.  Since September 2016 the Central Bank of Yemen (CBY) has existed in two competing branches—Aden (internationally‑recognized government) and Sana’a (Houthi‑controlled).  This article traces how the conflict over monetary policy intensified when the Sana’a branch banned newly‑printed banknotes from Aden and attempted to create a parallel electronic currency (the e‑Rial).  It examines the history of the currency war, regional enforcement of the banknote ban, the rise of black‑market trading, divergent exchange rates and the humanitarian toll.  The analysis also looks at how the Aden government responded, the impact on business and humanitarian transfers, and the looming threat of rapid currency depreciation .

Historical Backdrop: Fracturing of Monetary Policy

• Early fractures:  Following the Houthi takeover of Sana’a in September 2014 and subsequent civil war, frontlines hardened into a rough north–south divide.  Economic collapse ensued; by mid‑2016 around YR300 billion (US$1.2 billion) left the banking system as wealthy Yemenis and traders withdrew cash to the informal market .  Oil exports were suspended in 2015, depriving the CBY of its main foreign currency source .  Foreign reserves fell from US$4.6 billion (2014) to US$700 million by September 2016 .

• CBY relocation:  On September 18 2016, President Hadi ordered the CBY headquarters relocated to Aden, splitting the institution across frontlines .  The Aden branch inherited international recognition and the right to print money, while the Sana’a branch retained most staff, archives and control of Yemen’s largest markets .  The two branches have since fought over authority to regulate money supply, import financing, banks, and money exchangers .

• Expansionary monetary policy:  Beginning in January 2017, the Aden CBY imported new banknotes from Russia (YR200 billion initially) and continued printing through 2018, raising the money supply by roughly 53 percent .  By late 2019 some YR1.7 trillion in new Aden‑issued notes had been printed, according to Yemeni banking officials .  The World Bank noted that the mass issuance of new bills caused exchange rate instability: the rial depreciated from YR215/USD (2014) to YR516/USD (late 2018) .

Houthi Response and Escalation of Currency War

Early measures

• Initial ban on new bills (June 2017):  The Houthi‑run National Salvation Government prohibited the new YR500 notes printed in Aden from circulating in Houthi‑controlled areas .  Motivation included mitigating inflation caused by Aden’s expansionary policy and retaining control over the country’s largest currency market in Sana’a .  Houthi authorities convened repeated meetings with banks and money exchange outlets—many headquartered in Sana’a—to instruct them to refuse new notes and set aside any discovered bills for confiscation .

• Enforcement campaigns (2017–2019):  The Ministry of Industry and Trade ordered importers, wholesalers, malls and fuel stations not to deal with new YR500 and YR1,000 bills .  By mid‑December 2019 Houthi seizures of banned bills totaled over YR600 million .  The restrictions created a dual exchange rate, with the rial marginally stronger in Houthi‑controlled areas; the exchange rate differential varied between YR5 and YR15 .

Blanket banknote ban and e‑Rial (December 18 2019)

• Directive:  On December 18 2019, the Sana’a CBY issued a circular formally banning all Aden‑printed Yemeni rial banknotes and gave residents one month to trade them in .  The directive allowed exchanges for either old bills (pre‑Sept 2016) or electronic currency (e‑Rial) through specified service providers .  Those caught with new bills after January 17 2020 faced confiscation and possible imprisonment .

• Service providers:  The approved e‑Rial agents included M Floos (Al Kuraimi Islamic Microfinance Bank), Mobile Money (Cooperative & Agricultural Credit Bank), and Quality Connect (jointly owned by Yemen Kuwait Bank, Swaid & Sons Exchange and Al Akwaa Exchange) .  Customers could also exchange up to YR100,000 for old bills at these locations .  Unbanked Yemenis could receive in‑kind transfers (phone credit) instead of e‑Rials .  Previously confiscated new bills were to be converted into e‑Rials .

• Previous experiments:  The ban followed earlier Houthi attempts to decouple from Aden liquidity.  In April 2017 the authorities issued vouchers to cover basic foodstuffs for unpaid public employees; the scheme collapsed as merchants could not redeem vouchers for cash, leading to depreciation and a two‑tier price system .  In March 2018 the Houthis piloted an electronic currency and expanded it in April 2019 to pay Yemen Petroleum Company staff .  However, the e‑Rial remained limited to paying utility bills and phone services and lacked infrastructure for everyday transactions .  Only 6 percent of Yemenis held bank accounts pre‑conflict, making adoption difficult .

Regional enforcement and market reaction

• Uneven implementation:  Enforcement was strict in Sana’a and nearby governorates; businesses there stopped accepting new notes, leaving residents unable to purchase essentials like food, fuel and medicine .  In front‑line and mixed territories (Ibb, Taiz, Al‑Dhalea, Hudaydah, Al‑Jawf), new notes accounted for 60–70 percent of circulation, so a total ban was not enforced .  Houthi fighters in these areas received waivers.

• Black‑market arbitrage:  Only about 10 percent of new banknotes were surrendered during the grace period .  Many turned to black markets, trading new bills for old ones at a discount (e.g., YR10,000 new for YR9,000 old in Hudaydah) .  In Al‑Dhalea goods pricing reflected currency type, with old notes valued 1.10–1.12 times new ones .  Money transfer fees between government and Houthi areas surged from under 1 percent to roughly 12 percent .

• Divergent exchange rates:  By December 31 2019 the exchange rate was YR582/USD in Sana’a vs. YR612/USD in Aden—a 5 percent difference .  After the ban, new rials flowed into government areas, widening the gap; on January 14 2020, Aden’s rate reached YR655/USD compared to YR590/USD in Sana’a (11 percent differential) .  This dynamic increased profits for currency smuggling and arbitrage: traders could buy foreign currency in Houthi areas and sell it at a premium in Aden .

Response from Aden

• Official stance:  On December 22 the Aden CBY dismissed Sana’a’s ban, urging banks, businesses and money exchangers to continue using new banknotes .  It also restricted banks’ issuance of e‑Rials to 15 percent of their capital (capping potential e‑Rials at around YR5 billion) .

• Salary payments halted:  The Yemeni Ministry of Finance announced on December 30 that it could no longer transfer salaries and pensions to northern areas because banks refused to accept new bills .  Normally around YR12 billion per month reached roughly 1.25 million public employees and 40,000 pensioners through Al Kuraimi Islamic Microfinance Bank .  The government would now incur a 10 percent fee for any transfers to Houthi territories .  Some officials suspected that liquidity issues related to the near‑exhausted US$2 billion Saudi deposit (granted in 2018) made the ban a convenient pretext for ending payments .

• Foreign support running low:  By early 2020 the Aden CBY’s foreign currency reserves had fallen to about US$300 million, despite Saudi Arabia providing US$2.4 billion in foreign currency support and fuel grants since 2018 .  The Aden CBY relied on this support to underwrite imports and pay salaries, so dwindling reserves heightened the risk of rapid currency depreciation .

Economic and Social Implications

• Shrinkage of monetary supply:  The ban reduces physical cash in northern regions, squeezing consumer purchasing power in a country where inflation has already quadrupled prices since 2014 .  Small‑denomination notes (YR100, YR200) are deteriorating or scarce , compounding difficulties for day‑to‑day transactions.

• Business relocation:  Growing costs and risks in Houthi‑controlled areas have pushed some traders to move warehouses and operations to Aden or Marib .  Others use gold or goods to circumvent currency restrictions: they buy goods in government areas with new rials and sell them in northern areas for old notes or foreign currency .  Hard currencies (US dollars, Saudi riyals) are increasingly used for cross‑frontline transactions .

• Pressure on Aden:  An influx of new rials into government areas triggers inflation, depreciating the currency relative to the north .  As foreign reserves dwindle, the Aden CBY’s ability to defend the rial weakens, increasing the likelihood of further depreciation and heightened humanitarian hardship .

Insights and Takeaways
	•	Weaponization of currency:  The article demonstrates how currency supply has become a tool of warfare.  The Houthi ban and e‑Rial scheme aimed to neutralize Aden’s monetary leverage and assert control over northern markets, while the Aden government leveraged international recognition to print money and finance imports.  Ordinary Yemenis suffer the costs through loss of purchasing power, scarcity of small change, and restrictions on salary payments and remittances.
	•	Rise of informal finance:  The war for monetary control has empowered money exchangers and informal networks, which mediate cross‑frontline transfers and supply old notes.  Microfinance institutions like Al Kuraimi and CAC Bank are caught between the two authorities, facing coercion and compliance dilemmas.  Sanctions (e.g., later U.S. FTO designations) and de‑risking by international banks further push finance underground.
	•	International support is finite:  Foreign deposits and grants keep the Aden CBY afloat, but reserves are dwindling.  Without political settlement and unified policy, printing more money accelerates inflation, while bans and e‑Rial experiments aggravate scarcity in the north.  The article foreshadows the mounting pressure on both sides as currency divergence deepens and humanitarian conditions deteriorate.

This in‑depth analysis adds a more granular understanding of the actors (banks, exchangers, microfinance institutions), laws and regulations, and regional variations in enforcement.  The accumulative knowledge base now captures not only names and dates but also the dynamic interplay of policy decisions, market reactions, and socio‑economic impacts.  Subsequent deliverables will continue expanding this log, enriching it with information on microfinance, sanctions, international support and regulatory developments across Yemen’s financial landscape.

Article 11 – Yemen Economic Bulletin: Lebanon’s Financial Collapse Traps Yemeni Banks’ Money (May 8 2020)

Context and Purpose

Lebanon has long served as a regional banking hub and a critical financial conduit for Yemeni banks and traders.  This bulletin explains how the Lebanese financial crisis of 2019–2020—characterized by a collapsing currency, government debt default and informal capital controls—has trapped hundreds of millions of dollars belonging to Yemeni banks.  Since Yemen’s banks rely on foreign currency deposits abroad to finance imports of essential goods, the inability to access deposits in Beirut threatens to deepen Yemen’s humanitarian crisis.  The paper also outlines possible strategies for Yemeni banks to recover their funds and explores the implications for Yemen’s banking sector, importers, and international partners.

Why Yemeni Banks Turned to Lebanon

• Risk de‑risking drives capital to Lebanon:  Yemen’s high-risk designation by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) in 2015 led Western banks to close correspondent accounts and sever ties with Yemeni banks .  Lebanese banks, notably Bank of Beirut, continued to offer dollarized accounts and high interest rates, attracting Yemeni deposits .  As of October 2019, Yemeni banks held approximately US$240 million in foreign currency deposits in Lebanon—about 20 percent of their total foreign currency holdings .

• Trade financing hub:  Lebanon’s banking system became a vital clearinghouse for financing imports into Yemen.  Lebanese accounts allowed Yemeni importers to avoid currency conversion costs when purchasing goods denominated in US dollars or Saudi riyals .  This reliance deepened after Yemen’s foreign reserves dwindled and the CBY’s ability to support letters of credit shrank .

Lebanon’s Financial Crisis and Capital Controls

• Systemic collapse:  Lebanon’s crisis stemmed from years of mismanagement: a persistent balance of payments deficit, high government borrowing and a “financial engineering” scheme where Banque du Liban offered exorbitant interest rates to local banks for dollar deposits .  This created a Ponzi-like system; when foreign currency inflows fell, banks could no longer honor their obligations .  By late 2019 protests erupted, and banks introduced soft capital controls—limiting withdrawals and banning transfers abroad .  In March 2020 Lebanon defaulted on its sovereign debt for the first time , and the local currency lost more than 50 percent of its value .

• Funds frozen:  These controls trapped Yemeni banks’ deposits.  Yemeni bankers visiting Beirut in early 2020 found they could not withdraw funds; negotiations with Bank of Beirut and Lebanon’s central bank yielded no progress .  One Lebanese analyst suggested Yemeni deposits might never be recovered without a “haircut” (reduction in value) .  Yemeni banks’ inability to access their money undermines confidence, delays shipments and jeopardizes future trade deals  .

Impact on Yemen’s Economy and Banking Sector

Import financing and humanitarian implications

• Commodity imports at risk:  Yemen imports up to 90 percent of its essential food commodities .  Formal banks facilitate these imports by providing letters of credit and foreign currency.  With US$240 million frozen in Lebanon and Yemen’s foreign reserves nearly depleted, banks lack liquidity to finance imports.  Exporters have withheld shipments until unpaid debts are settled, creating delays and higher prices  .

• Depreciation pressure:  Foreign currency shortages could lead to further depreciation of the Yemeni rial, eroding purchasing power and exacerbating food insecurity .  Confidence in Yemeni banks weakens when money is inaccessible; this discourages depositors and raises the risk of further capital flight to informal networks or cash hoarding.

Reliance on informal networks and remittances

• Hawala networks:  As formal channels falter, importers increasingly rely on hawala networks (informal money transfer systems) to obtain foreign currency.  Hawala brokers link Yemeni importers to diaspora remittances and foreign currency sources .  These transactions bypass bank restrictions but carry higher exchange rates and limited oversight, increasing vulnerability to money laundering and terror financing .

• Remittances as lifeline:  Remittances from Yemeni expatriates (mainly in Saudi Arabia) became even more critical for financing imports when oil exports ceased and the CBY’s reserves dwindled .  Money exchange companies and hawala dealers play a larger role in channeling remittances, further marginalizing formal banks .

International support and dwindling reserves

• Saudi deposits and grants:  Saudi Arabia provided a US$2 billion deposit in March 2018 to underwrite letters of credit for five essential commodities and later topped it with US$200 million and fuel grants .  By 2020, less than US$200 million remained from this deposit .  The near‑exhaustion of Saudi support magnifies the significance of funds trapped in Lebanon .  If Riyadh cannot provide similar aid due to falling oil prices and economic strain, Yemeni importers will face even greater challenges accessing foreign currency.

• International actors:  The article notes that donors and organisations like the World Bank, IMF and UN have a stake in unfreezing Yemeni deposits to ensure humanitarian imports continue .  Lebanon’s request for an IMF bailout could present leverage; concessions on Yemeni funds might be tied to such rescue packages .

Proposed Strategies: Negotiation, Persuasion or Litigation

The bulletin outlines three potential avenues for Yemeni banks:
	1.	Negotiation:  Yemeni and Lebanese stakeholders could negotiate a compromise to release a portion of the frozen deposits .  This pragmatic approach acknowledges the reality of Lebanon’s crisis while seeking partial relief for Yemeni banks.
	2.	Persuasion via international pressure:  International organisations and donor countries might press Lebanese authorities to free Yemeni funds, especially as Lebanon seeks an IMF bailout .  By tying concessions to financial rescue packages, Yemeni banks could obtain support for at least some of their deposits.
	3.	Litigation:  As a last resort, Yemeni banks could pursue legal action.  The article cites the case of oil trader IMMS, which sued BankMed in a New York court over a US$1 billion frozen deposit and reached a settlement .  However, litigation is costly and uncertain; therefore, negotiation or international pressure is preferable .

Stakeholders and Sub‑Sectors Impacted

Stakeholder / Entity	Role / Sector	Impact or Action
Yemeni commercial & Islamic banks	Formal banking sector	Deposited ~US$240 million in Lebanon to facilitate imports ; funds frozen under Lebanese capital controls; face liquidity shortages and loss of credibility .
Lebanese banking sector (Bank of Beirut)	Regional banking hub	Hosted Yemeni deposits; enforced withdrawal bans; stands accused of operating a Ponzi‑like scheme ; subject to negotiation or legal action .
Banque du Liban (Lebanon’s central bank)	Monetary authority	Offered high‑interest “financial engineering” products to local banks; central to Lebanon’s crisis ; engages with Yemeni delegation but offers no resolution .
FATF and global financial regulators	International compliance bodies	Elevated Yemen to high-risk status in 2015, leading Western banks to sever ties and pushing Yemeni banks toward Lebanon .
Yemeni importers & traders	Private sector	Depend on foreign currency deposits to finance shipments of food and fuel; shipments delayed and new trade deals jeopardized due to frozen funds .
Money exchangers & hawala networks	Informal finance	Bridge gaps in formal banking; channel remittances and provide foreign currency at higher cost .
Saudi Arabia	External donor	Provided US$2 billion deposit and additional grants to support CBY and imports ; reserves nearly depleted by 2020 .
International financial institutions (IMF, World Bank, UN)	Multilateral organisations	Potential mediators; could leverage Lebanon’s request for assistance to secure release of Yemeni funds .
Yemeni diaspora	Remitters	Send remittances through hawala networks; key source of foreign currency for importers .

Legal and Regulatory Developments
Date & Measure	Issuing Authority	Purpose & Implications
FATF high‑risk designation (2015)	Financial Action Task Force	Elevated Yemen to ‘high risk,’ prompting Western banks to sever correspondent relations; drove Yemeni deposits to Lebanon .
Soft capital controls (Nov 2019)	Lebanese banks	Limited withdrawals and barred transfers abroad ; effectively froze foreign deposits including Yemeni funds.
Lebanon sovereign default (Mar 2020)	Lebanese government	First-ever default on debt ; exacerbated banking crisis and currency collapse.
IMMS lawsuit against BankMed (Nov 2019 – Apr 2020)	Private litigation	Oil trader sued BankMed for US$1 billion; settlement reached ; shows potential legal avenue for recovering deposits.


Insights and Takeaways
	•	Interconnected crises:  The Lebanese collapse exposes how financial shocks in one regional hub can reverberate through Yemen’s already fragile economy.  Because Yemen’s banks lacked other correspondent options due to sanctions and de‑risking, they concentrated deposits in Lebanon—only to find them trapped when that system failed.
	•	Importance of risk diversification:  Yemeni banks’ reliance on a single jurisdiction underscores the need to diversify correspondent relationships (e.g., UAE, Turkey) even at the cost of additional currency conversion fees .  Without diversification, future crises may again freeze critical funds.
	•	Role of international partners:  Donor countries and multilateral institutions can leverage Lebanon’s need for economic rescue to secure the release of Yemeni deposits.  Tying IMF or World Bank aid to concessions on Yemeni funds could open space for negotiation .
	•	Shift toward informal finance:  The inability of banks to access funds strengthens hawala networks and money exchangers.  While these networks ensure imports continue, they also operate outside regulatory frameworks, increasing risks of money laundering and terror financing .

Article 12 – Yemen Economic Bulletin: Using IMF Support to Mitigate Currency Collapse (October 22 2021)

Context and Purpose

By late 2021 the Yemeni rial (YR) was in freefall.  Following a modest recovery after the 2018 currency crisis, the rial had depreciated to more than YR 1,300 per US$1 in areas nominally controlled by the internationally recognised government while remaining around YR 600 per US$1 in Houthi‑controlled areas .  This collapse, driven by dwindling foreign reserves, massive monetary expansion and loss of confidence in Aden‑printed money, triggered price hikes and social unrest and threatened Yemen’s already fragile food security.  At the same time the International Monetary Fund (IMF) allocated roughly US$665 million in Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) to Yemen—part of its global COVID‑19 recovery package—offering a potential lifeline .  This bulletin explains the background to the currency collapse, assesses the government’s capacity to deploy the IMF support, and lays out policy recommendations for stabilising the rial and restoring confidence in Yemen’s banking system.

Historical backdrop: recurrent currency crises

• Bifurcated exchange rates:  Since the CBY split in September 2016, Yemen has operated two de‑facto monetary zones.  Houthi‑controlled areas banned Aden‑printed notes, leading to a stable exchange rate around YR 600/USD; government areas relied on printed cash and foreign deposits, causing the exchange rate to plummet to YR 1,300/USD by mid‑October 2021 .  The disparity reflected divergent policies and resources: Sana’a enjoyed inflows of foreign currency through remittances and trade, while Aden depleted its reserves and printed new money.

• Exhausted foreign reserves:  The Aden‑based CBY had essentially exhausted its foreign currency reserves by late 2021 .  The $2 billion Saudi deposit, which stabilised the rial in 2018–19 by financing imports of wheat, rice, sugar, milk and cooking oil, was nearly spent by the end of 2020, with only US$11.3 million remaining .  Meanwhile remittances—the largest source of Yemen’s foreign currency—declined sharply due to COVID‑19 restrictions .

• Expansionary monetary policy:  To finance government spending, mainly salaries for public servants and security forces, the CBY‑Aden printed vast amounts of money.  The resulting surge in currency supply, combined with foreign currency scarcity, fueled depreciation and inflation .  Houthi advances on the battlefield further undermined confidence in Aden‑issued currency, prompting people in government‑held areas to hoard dollars and Saudi riyals .

IMF allocation and potential impact

The IMF’s August 23 2021 SDR allocation extended US$665 million to Yemen (SDR 466.8 million)  .  Combined with a previous SDR allocation from 2009, Yemen’s net cumulative entitlement reached SDR 699 million (≈US$1 billion) .  SDRs are reserve assets that can be exchanged for convertible currencies through arrangements with other IMF members; likely partners for Yemen include the United States, United Kingdom and Saudi Arabia .  Should bilateral exchanges not materialise, the IMF can designate partners to ensure liquidity .  While the SDR allocation falls far short of Yemen’s financing needs , careful utilisation could stabilise the currency and attract further aid .

Challenges facing effective use of IMF support
	1.	Institutional weakness and corruption:  The CBY‑Aden suffers from weak governance and capacity following its relocation to Aden in 2016.  A UN Panel of Experts report accused the Yemeni government and CBY‑Aden of mismanaging the US$2 billion Saudi deposit and embezzling nearly US$500 million through preferential exchange rates for import financing—allegations later withdrawn but reflecting real opacity and fertile ground for corruption .  The CBY‑Aden’s credibility is undermined by ongoing internal divisions within the anti‑Houthi coalition (e.g., Southern Transitional Council) .
	2.	Limited foreign currency channels:  Since international aid agencies refused to channel funds through CBY‑Aden, the bank struggled to replenish reserves .  With Saudi Arabia reluctant to inject new deposits and remittances down, the CBY had few avenues to access hard currency .
	3.	Extreme humanitarian urgency:  Rapid currency depreciation drove up prices of basic goods and triggered protests across southern and eastern Yemen .  Yemen imports up to 90 percent of its food; thus exchange‑rate stability is vital to prevent famine .

Policy recommendations and proposed mechanisms

The bulletin recommends a two‑phase strategy: immediate measures to stabilise the currency and longer‑term reforms to rebuild financial governance.

Address immediate needs

• Form an Emergency Committee:  Create a temporary committee composed of technocrats from the CBY‑Aden, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Industry and Trade, Economic Committee and other relevant bodies, working in consultation with the IMF .  This committee should design a transparent mechanism to deploy the SDR funds specifically for currency stabilisation in southern and eastern Yemen .

• Abolish preferential exchange rates:  The previous import financing mechanism used a fixed exchange rate lower than market rates, incentivising arbitrage and corruption.  The new scheme should set the import financing rate YR 10 lower than the market weighted average at the time of each deal .  Only staple foods should be financed; sugar, which constitutes about 10 percent of imports and benefits manufacturers more than consumers, should be excluded .

• Limit SDR disbursement:  Access to the IMF funds should be capped initially, with details and transactions published promptly to promote transparency and build confidence .

• Replace CBY‑Aden leadership:  The article calls for replacing the CBY‑Aden governor and board, citing their inability to fulfil the bank’s mandate and eroded trust among domestic and international stakeholders .  Competent technocrats with a public‑service track record should assume these roles, and the Emergency Committee should dissolve once a new board is installed .

Beyond immediate needs

• Develop comprehensive SDR frameworks:  The new CBY leadership, with IMF guidance, should create a coherent plan for deploying Yemen’s SDR allocation.  This includes assessing macroeconomic impacts, prioritising expenditures, and identifying risks associated with misuse or lack of transparency .

• Evaluate import financing functions:  If an import financing mechanism remains necessary, the CBY should adopt a conservative exchange‑rate policy and issue letters of credit (LoCs) at rates close to the prevailing parallel market in each region.  LoC proceeds collected in Houthi areas should go toward paying salaries of public employees there .

• Diversify foreign currency sources:  Yemen must revive domestic revenue streams to reduce dependence on aid.  The bulletin proposes financing development projects to rehabilitate oil and natural gas infrastructure, maintain and expand export pipelines, and improve security conditions to boost production  .

Insights and takeaways
	•	Leadership matters:  Stabilising the Yemeni rial hinges on credible, competent management of the CBY‑Aden.  The article emphasises replacing the current leadership and establishing a technocratic emergency committee to restore confidence .  This signals to donors and markets that reforms are underway, potentially unlocking further support.
	•	Transparency and targeted financing:  The previous Saudi deposit and import financing scheme created opportunities for corruption and arbitrage, undermining the currency’s stability.  The new mechanism must align the import financing rate closely with market rates, exclude non‑staple commodities like sugar, and publish transaction details .  Transparency will deter rent‑seeking and build trust.
	•	Diversification and self‑reliance:  While external financial assistance is crucial, Yemen cannot rely solely on aid.  Reviving oil and gas production, mobilising domestic revenues and fostering cooperation across frontlines will reduce dependence on foreign deposits .
	•	Broader significance:  The currency crisis is symptomatic of Yemen’s fragmented governance and prolonged conflict.  Stabilising the rial requires not only financial management but also political compromises, institutional rebuilding and inclusive economic policies.  The IMF SDR allocation provides a window of opportunity; if squandered, Yemen could slide deeper into hyperinflation and famine.

Article 13 – Yemen Economic Bulletin: The CBY‑Aden’s Crisis of Confidence – Assessing the UN Panel of Experts’ Corruption Allegations (March 26 2021)

Context and Purpose

In January 2021 the United Nations Panel of Experts on Yemen published its annual report accusing the internationally recognised Yemeni government, the Aden‑based Central Bank of Yemen (CBY‑Aden) and major importers of colluding to embezzle roughly US$423 million from a Saudi deposit intended to finance basic food imports.  The panel claimed that the CBY‑Aden offered importers preferential exchange rates well below market rates, enabling them to capture enormous profits while ordinary Yemenis saw no benefit.  This Sana’a Center bulletin scrutinises the panel’s claims, highlighting errors in its evidence and reasoning, and assesses broader issues of transparency and governance at the CBY‑Aden.  It argues that while the specific accusations are flawed, there is indeed a crisis of confidence in the CBY‑Aden that demands urgent reform  .

Background: Yemen’s import financing system

• Pre‑conflict stability:  Prior to 2015, Yemen imported up to 90 percent of its food needs and the CBY maintained a fixed peg of YR 215 per US$1 by judiciously regulating foreign exchange and issuing letters of credit (LCs) to importers .  In 2014, foreign reserves stood at US$5.3 billion and oil and gas exports supplied the bulk of hard currency .

• Seeds of currency diversion:  The war’s eruption in 2015 caused economic collapse and nearly halted oil exports.  The CBY spent almost 40 percent of its reserves financing essential imports in the first half of 2015 .  As reserves dwindled, the bank ended sugar subsidies and devalued the official rate to YR 250/US$1 .  By mid‑2016 the rial traded at over YR 300/USD, prompting the bank’s relocation to Aden and creating two rival central banks .

• Saudi deposit and LC mechanism:  In March 2018 Riyadh deposited US$2 billion at the CBY‑Aden to finance imports of wheat, rice, sugar, milk and cooking oil .  The programme aimed to stabilise the rial and food prices by offering importers letters of credit at a preferential exchange rate below the market rate.  By November 2018 the rial had appreciated from YR 732 to YR 518 per US$1, and food prices fell modestly .

The Panel of Experts’ allegations

• Embezzlement claims:  The panel asserted that between July 2018 and August 2020 the CBY‑Aden offered importers an average LC rate of YR 570/US$1 while the market rate averaged YR 683/US$1, creating a 29 percent differential .  Over 38 LC batches (US$1.89 billion), this allegedly diverted US$423 million to “preferred traders,” notably the Hayel Saeed Anam (HSA) Group, which the panel claimed received 48 percent of the deposit .  The panel also accused Governor Mohammed Zammam and successive CBY leadership of violating Decree 75 (2018) and the Central Bank Law by setting preferential rates and failing to seek maximum returns .

• Impact on Yemenis:  The panel argued that the preferential rates did not lower consumer prices: in 2019 the rial depreciated 23 percent and the minimum food basket price rose 21 percent, with sugar and oil prices soaring .  It concluded that the CBY‑Aden colluded with businesses to launder money and denied Yemenis their right to food .

Evidence gaps and analytical errors

The bulletin identifies significant flaws in the panel’s case:
	1.	Misinterpreting exchange rate trends:  The panel used WFP data covering August 2019 to August 2020 but applied it to 2019.  In reality, the rial stabilised and food prices fell when the LC mechanism disbursed most of the deposit (Nov 2018–Dec 2019).  Rapid depreciation occurred in early 2020 after the Houthi–government monetary split deepened .
	2.	Incorrect calculation of differentials:  Recalculating the panel’s own data shows the average LC rate was YR 469.8/US$1 versus a YR 585.6/US$1 market rate, implying a 24.6 percent differential, not 29 percent.  Moreover, the panel used exchange rates from Houthi areas only; using national averages reduces the estimated arbitrage by about US$76 million .
	3.	Misidentifying beneficiaries:  The panel erroneously included Aden Silos & Mills (owned by the Al Rowaishan Group) as part of HSA Group when calculating its share of the deposit.  Correcting this reduces HSA’s share to 45 percent, not 48 percent .
	4.	Legal misinterpretations:  The panel conflated the CBY’s mandate to maintain price stability with outdated provisions from the 1991 CBY law emphasising profit maximisation.  Law 14 of 2000 prioritises price stability , giving the bank discretion to set exchange rates.  Governor Zammam’s mechanism (average of rates at major banks/exchangers minus YR 10–15) was legally allowed, though poorly monitored .

Salient concerns and systemic issues

Although the panel’s specific accusations falter, the bulletin underscores genuine problems:

• Elite capture and market concentration:  Yemen’s food import market has long been dominated by a few conglomerates.  Decree 75 (2018) limited import financing to five commodities, indirectly granting large traders privileged access to foreign currency and encouraging monopoly .  Competition is further hampered by logistical constraints, Houthi interference and international banking restrictions.

• Lack of oversight and transparency:  Since the CBY relocated to Aden, there have been no comprehensive audits and little public disclosure .  Internal governance is crippled by political infighting and ambiguous authority, with multiple leadership changes and board disputes.

• Currency divergence and humanitarian impact:  The split between CBY‑Aden and CBY‑Sana’a has produced dual exchange rates, undermined price regulation and eroded public trust.  Donors like Saudi Arabia may withhold future support, exacerbating currency depreciation and food insecurity .

Recommendations from the bulletin

For the Yemeni government:
	1.	Dismiss and replace CBY‑Aden leadership:  Remove the entire senior leadership and board, appointing politically unaffiliated technocrats with proven integrity .
	2.	Conduct independent audits and investigations:  Mandate comprehensive audits of all CBY operations and transactions related to the Saudi deposit and foreign currency sales/purchases; publish the results .
	3.	Pursue legal accountability:  Investigate and prosecute current and former CBY governors and board members for any violations of Yemeni law .
	4.	Reform market structure:  Explore policies to reduce oligopolistic tendencies and foster competition in the food import market .

For CBY‑Aden under new leadership:
	1.	Publish Saudi deposit distribution data:  Release detailed information on which importers received funds and in what amounts .
	2.	Strengthen governance and transparency:  Overhaul institutional structures, develop clear monetary policy frameworks and implement accountability measures in the import financing system .
	3.	Adopt a unified managed float:  Eliminate multiple internal exchange rates and adopt a managed float, adjusting interventions based on foreign currency availability and market dynamics .
	4.	Publish financial statements and bulletins:  Resume regular release of financial statements, monthly monetary bulletins and annual reports .

For HSA Group and other major traders:  Conduct independent audits of their participation in the LC mechanism and publish pricing data to demonstrate transparency .

For the UN Panel of Experts:  Correct factual errors, review methodologies and consult Yemeni experts to improve future reports .

Insights and takeaways
	•	Evidence matters:  Robust economic analysis must be grounded in accurate data and context.  The UN panel’s miscalculations underscore how erroneous statistics can mislead policy and erode trust.  Independent audits and transparency are essential to restore confidence.
	•	Systemic reform versus scapegoating:  While individual misdeeds should be prosecuted, Yemen’s currency and food crises stem from structural issues: dual central banks, monopolistic import markets, political infighting and inadequate regulation.  Replacing leadership without addressing institutional weaknesses will not suffice.
	•	Transparency and competition:  Publishing detailed data on foreign currency allocations and import financing, auditing major traders, and fostering a competitive market are key to preventing elite capture and ensuring subsidies reach consumers.
	•	International credibility:  Donor confidence hinges on credible, impartial management of aid funds.  Demonstrating responsible use of the Saudi deposit and implementing IMF‑guided reforms (as described in Article 12) can unlock additional support and mitigate humanitarian catastrophe.

Deep‑Dive Analysis: Yemen Economic Bulletin – The Limited Efficacy of US Sanctions on Houthi Financial Networks (December 17 2021)

Context and Purpose of the Bulletin

In December 2021 the Sana’a Center’s Economic Unit examined a series of US sanctions aimed at dismantling the Houthi movement’s financial lifelines.  The bulletin argues that although the sanctions have disrupted some channels, their overall impact has been limited and may unintentionally worsen Yemen’s humanitarian crisis.  Since the war began, de‑risking by international banks and conflict‑induced fragmentation have driven financial flows out of regulated banks into informal hawala networks.  Money exchange companies became pivotal players; among them Swaid & Sons grew into one of Yemen’s largest exchange houses, operating across the country and internationally .

The article traces the United States’ escalating sanctions campaign in 2021.  In January 2021 the outgoing Trump administration announced it would designate the Houthi movement (Ansar Allah) as a Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO) .  Humanitarian agencies and lawmakers warned that such a designation would obstruct aid to the majority of Yemenis living under Houthi control.  President Biden revoked the FTO listing in February  but Washington continued to sanction Houthi commanders and financiers individually .  By mid‑2021 the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) broadened its focus beyond the Houthis’ military leadership to their economic foundations, targeting a smuggling network led by Sa’id Ahmad Muhammad al‑Jamal (based in Iran) and the money‑exchange giant Swaid & Sons .

How Swaid & Sons Became Yemen’s Financial Powerhouse

The bulletin dedicates a large section to tracing Swaid & Sons’ evolution from a textile shop in Sana’a into a money‑market empire.  Founder Mohammed Lotf Swaid launched his first exchange shop in 1998; by 2008 the company was legally registered as a multi‑partner money exchange and transfer house .  As Yemen’s banking system began disintegrating after 2015, Swaid & Sons expanded rapidly by:
	•	Developing digital transfer networks:  The company created the Floosak electronic money service and Mal Money Transfer, linking it to exchangers nationwide and to major firms such as MoneyGram and Western Union .
	•	Leveraging regulatory gaps:  Yemen’s cash‑based economy and the 2016 split of the Central Bank of Yemen (CBY) into rival offices in Aden and Sana’a eroded regulatory oversight .  Unlicensed exchangers proliferated, and hawala networks filled the void as banks lost correspondent services .  Swaid’s networks became indispensable to commercial traders and even banks seeking rial liquidity or hard currency .
	•	Acting as a clearing house:  By 2016–20 Swaid & Sons handled at least 20% of Yemen’s foreign currency trading .  Banks and businesses relied on it to access foreign exchange and transfer funds, often at high premiums.

The firm’s nationwide network allowed the Houthi authorities to shift old banknotes from government‑controlled areas into Houthi territory after their ban on newly printed rials (December 2019).  This helped the CBY‑Sana’a capture scarce old notes, while government areas were flooded with new, depreciating currency .

Sanctions Against the Smuggling Network and Swaid & Sons

OFAC’s June 10 2021 update to its Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) list targeted twelve members of al‑Jamal’s smuggling network, including Syrians, Turks, and Emirati‑registered companies, as well as Swaid & Sons .  The Treasury said al‑Jamal smuggled Iranian fuel and commodities to customers across the Middle East and Asia, with tens of millions of dollars funneled through Swaid & Sons to finance the Houthis and Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps–Quds Force .  Businessmen in this network included Hani ‘Abd‑al‑Majid Muhammad As’ad (al‑Jamal’s accountant in Turkey) and various companies (Adoon General Trading FZE, and others) .

Domestic reactions and enforcement challenges

The sanctions triggered rapid responses inside Yemen but enforcement proved patchy:
	•	Government‑led freeze orders:  The Aden‑based Public Prosecution Office (PPO) issued Decree 15 adding sanctioned entities to a domestic terrorism list.  The CBY‑Aden directed banks and exchange houses to freeze Swaid’s accounts and revoke its licenses .
	•	Industry opposition:  The Sana’a‑based Yemeni Money Exchange Association condemned the US sanctions and called for their cancellation, warning of harm to the broader financial sector .
	•	Ignored directives:  Despite the decree, most Yemeni banks and financial actors (largely headquartered in Sana’a) faced Houthi pressure to ignore the sanctions.  Only Swaid’s branch in Marib was closed; the company’s nationwide Mal network continued operations, and no comprehensive asset freeze occurred .
	•	Loss of correspondence:  Major international transfer companies (MoneyGram, Western Union, Xpress Money) severed ties with Swaid, damaging its reputation and limiting its formal access to global financial systems .  Yet the firm continued to operate internationally via hawala networks and by serving as an agent for license‑holding banks .

The bulletin notes that Swaid held only one known foreign bank account (US$20 million in Oman), which had been frozen before the June sanctions .  Many of its overseas funds were held via correspondent networks in the UAE and Saudi Arabia; thus the direct impact on its foreign assets appears limited .

Sanctions’ Broader Impact on the Houthi Movement

The bulletin argues that current sanctions are unlikely to dismantle the Houthis’ financing networks:
	•	Assets beyond reach:  Al‑Jamal’s network and similar schemes likely keep significant assets outside US jurisdiction, limiting direct vulnerability to asset freezes .
	•	Learning from allies:  The Houthis can draw on coping strategies developed by Lebanese Hezbollah and Iran, which have long operated under sanctions .
	•	Self‑reliant financing:  As a de facto government, the Houthi movement controls state institutions, collects taxes and customs, and extracts resources from local populations.  Iranian support continues via subsidized fuel and arms smuggling through Omani and Somali routes .  These informal channels are difficult to monitor and have proven resilient .
	•	War economy expansion:  Yemen’s war economy has spawned a black market of dubious transfer networks and speculative currency traders, making sanctions easier to evade .  The FTO revocation also eased compliance burdens for businesses interacting with Houthis, limiting pressure on their financing .

Looking Ahead: Balancing Sanctions with Humanitarian Needs

Sanctions can worsen Yemen’s humanitarian crisis by hampering foreign trade and increasing compliance costs:
	•	Humanitarian dependence on imports:  Roughly 90% of Yemen’s food is imported, and 20.7 million people need humanitarian assistance .  Sanctions that disrupt trade or raise transaction costs can inflate prices and exacerbate famine.
	•	De‑risking by global banks:  Foreign banks often implement over‑compliance measures, effectively severing Yemeni businesses from global finance .  This drives more money into informal markets, undermining efforts to stabilize the rial and finance legitimate trade.
	•	Monitoring and strategy:  The article calls for a monitoring system to assess sanctions’ effects on the financial sector, humanitarian conditions and political dynamics .  Without a comprehensive strategy responsive to local market realities, sanctions risk deepening economic fragmentation and human suffering .

Key Takeaways
	1.	Informal networks rule:  The collapse of Yemen’s banking system and international de‑risking have enabled money exchange companies like Swaid & Sons to dominate financial flows.  These networks operate beyond the reach of formal regulators, complicating sanctions enforcement.
	2.	Sanctions have limited bite:  OFAC designations damaged Swaid & Sons’ formal international relationships and spurred domestic freeze decrees, but the company continues to operate through hawala networks and under Houthi protection .  The smuggling network’s assets are largely outside US jurisdiction , and the Houthis remain financially resilient.
	3.	Humanitarian risks:  Yemen imports nearly all its food.  Sanctions that impede trade or increase compliance costs risk exacerbating famine and poverty.  Monitoring systems must track how sanctions affect the economy and humanitarian landscape .
	4.	Need for strategic coherence:  Sanctions should form part of a broader plan that also addresses currency stability, CBY reunification and the informal financial sector.  Without alignment, economic fragmentation may intensify and prolong the conflict.

Progress Check: Implementation of Previous Recommendations
Topic	Prior Recommendations	Evidence of Implementation / Current Status
Reunifying the Central Bank (2016 – 2018)	Earlier articles stressed unifying CBY operations, restoring salary payments and halting unregulated printing.	The article shows the CBY remains split; the currency war intensified when CBY-Sana’a banned new notes (2019). Sanctions have not addressed this fundamental divide, indicating limited progress.
Regulating Money Exchangers (2019)	Calls to regulate exchangers and integrate them into formal systems.	The proliferation of hawala networks and Swaid & Sons’ dominance indicates regulation remains weak. CBY-Aden’s attempt to revoke licenses was largely ignored due to Houthi pressure .
Diversifying Public Revenues	Past policy briefs recommended reducing reliance on oil and customs by expanding taxation and fostering microfinance.	The article does not mention significant diversification. Houthi authorities instead extract revenues through smuggling and taxation in controlled areas .
Monitoring Sanctions Effects	Several analyses call for assessing sanctions’ humanitarian impact before implementation.	The bulletin reiterates this need, highlighting that sanctions risk worsening humanitarian crises unless accompanied by monitoring and tailored strategies .
International Support to CBY & Financial Sector	Repeated recommendations for Saudi deposits, IMF SDR utilisation and donor coordination.	No new deposits or major financial support are noted in this article. Instead, the focus is on US sanctions, indicating that foreign aid flows remain insufficient to stabilise the rial or restore banking confidence.

Financial & Banking Series – Article 15 (2020)

Overview

This deliverable examines the November 27 2020 Yemen Economic Bulletin “Battle to Regulate Banks Threatens to Rupture the Financial Sector” from the Sana’a Center for Strategic Studies.  The piece chronicles how the rivalry between the two central banks – the internationally recognised Central Bank of Yemen in Aden (CBY‑Aden) and the Houthi‑controlled Central Bank in Sana’a (CBY‑Sana’a) – escalated into an open battle for control over banks’ operational data, threatening to fracture the formal financial sector.  It details the competing decrees issued by both banks, the coercive tactics used by authorities, the humanitarian implications of the standoff, and the urgent need for third‑party mediation.  This summary contextualises those events within Yemen’s broader economic collapse and updates the cumulative knowledge base with new actors, regulations and events.

Key findings and chronology

1. Escalation of the data war
	•	Competing demands for banking data:  In early 2020 the CBY‑Sana’a banned banks from sharing data with CBY‑Aden, while CBY‑Aden demanded complete access to bank records to monitor compliance with anti‑money‑laundering regulations and manage foreign currency auctions.  Because 17 of Yemen’s 18 banks and most exchange companies are headquartered in Sana’a, the CBY‑Sana’a retained physical control over banking records and could enforce its ban.  CBY‑Aden, lacking such leverage, threatened punitive measures for non‑compliance and referred three banks – the International Bank of Yemen (IBY), Yemen Kuwait Bank (YKB) and Yemen Bank for Reconstruction & Development (YBRD) – to public prosecution .
	•	Use of coercion:  Houthi authorities closed branches of Al‑Kuraimi Islamic Microfinance Bank in March 2020 to force the bank to halt data sharing.  The bank reopened only after paying fines and pledging to stop providing information to Aden .  CBY‑Aden responded by levying fines on banks and threatening to suspend SWIFT access for non‑compliant institutions.  Some branches were told they could only reopen if they agreed to refrain from sharing data with Aden .
	•	Yemen Banks Association (YBA) mediation:  The YBA attempted to mediate, initially threatening partial strikes and eventually offering a compromise whereby banks would share data on transactions in government‑controlled areas while CBY‑Aden would suspend prosecutions .  This compromise was not accepted by either central bank, leaving the standoff unresolved.

2. Humanitarian and economic impacts
	•	Aid flows and humanitarian risk:  The banks targeted by CBY‑Aden – IBY, YKB, YBRD, Al‑Kuraimi and Tadhamon International Islamic Bank – handle most UN and NGO foreign aid flows.  According to ACAPS estimates, roughly 80 % of humanitarian funds in 2018 flowed through banks based in Houthi‑controlled areas .  The standoff therefore threatened to disrupt cash‑based aid distribution and humanitarian import financing, exacerbating the ongoing food insecurity and medical shortages.  International donors deposit foreign currency in offshore accounts; the banks then convert it to rials and distribute locally.  Without cooperation between the two CBYs, this system cannot function effectively. 
	•	Liquidity crisis and inflation:  Yemen’s financial sector was already strained by foreign currency shortages, declining remittances, exhaustion of Saudi deposits, and the impact of the Southern Transitional Council’s (STC) self‑rule declaration in 2020 .  With both CBY branches printing money to fund deficits and refusing to coordinate, the rial continued to depreciate and reliance on unregulated exchange markets grew.  The standoff over data worsened these dynamics by pushing transactions further into informal networks and raising the risk of bank runs.

3. Future scenarios and recommendations
	•	Potential escalations:  The article outlines several possible developments.  CBY‑Aden could move YBRD’s headquarters to Aden (as it did previously with the Cooperative & Agricultural Credit Bank, CAC Bank).  It might also suspend SWIFT access for the non‑compliant banks.  Meanwhile CBY‑Sana’a is likely to continue blocking data sharing to undermine CBY‑Aden’s oversight, which would deepen the division and accelerate the creation of two parallel financial systems .
	•	Need for third‑party mediation:  Without intervention from international stakeholders (UN Special Envoy, the Yemen Quad, European Union, World Bank, IMF, Islamic Development Bank and Gulf donors), the economic conflict will continue.  The article calls for the creation of a new mediation framework to facilitate information sharing, unify monetary policy and protect humanitarian funds .  A failure to act will push Yemen closer to famine and irreparably damage its banking sector.

Analysis and takeaways
	1.	Banking sector fragmentation:  This article illustrates how economic war tactics have shifted from direct military confrontation to institutional sabotage.  By competing over control of bank data, the rival CBYs turned financial regulation into a weapon.  The consequence is a dual banking system where depositors’ trust erodes and informal money‑changer networks expand – trends that were already noted in earlier articles from 2016–18 and continue into 2020.
	2.	Aid as a battlefield:  Because the targeted banks process humanitarian funds, the data conflict directly jeopardises relief efforts.  Sanctions and designations (discussed in the December 2021 article) already forced international banks to de‑risk.  Now domestic institutions risk paralysis due to political manoeuvring.  This underscores the need to ring‑fence humanitarian finance from economic warfare.
	3.	Reinforcement of earlier trends:  The article confirms previous warnings (2016 – 2019) that splitting the central bank and printing new money would undermine monetary stability.  By 2020 this had escalated into mutual sabotage.  The standoff is a symptom of a larger failure to establish a unified regulatory framework; thus, solutions must address not only bank data sharing but also currency supply, debt servicing, and regulatory cooperation.
	4.	International leverage:  External actors have leverage to incentivise cooperation (e.g., linking aid disbursement to compliance, providing technical assistance for data sharing, or conditioning access to foreign currency auctions).  However, as seen in later articles (2024–2025), sustained donor support is dwindling, making a durable resolution urgent.

Echoes earlier recommendations to reunify the central bank (articles 7–8) and to use international aid strategically (articles 9–10). Highlights continuity and divergence in policy suggestions across the series.

Progress check on earlier recommendations

This article does not indicate substantial progress on earlier calls to reunify the CBY or stabilise the currency.  The data war shows that recommendations for dialogue and institution‑building have not been implemented.  Later articles (2023–2025) reveal that the economic war continued and even intensified, leading to further fragmentation and external interventions.

Conclusion

The November 2020 bulletin underscores how Yemen’s central banking schism has evolved into a direct contest for control over banking data.  This contest exacerbates monetary instability, undermines humanitarian finance and deepens public distrust in formal financial institutions.  It reveals that without an immediate, internationally backed mediation mechanism and clear legal frameworks, the rivalry between the two CBYs will push Yemen’s economy closer to collapse and hinder any future recovery.  The article is thus a critical bridge in the financial‑banking series, linking earlier currency‑collapse narratives to the later analyses of sanctions, microfinance challenges, and fiscal crises.

Financial & Banking Series – Article 16 (2023)

Overview

This deliverable provides an in‑depth analysis of the March 2 2023 Sana’a Center policy brief “Bridging the Divide: Mitigating the Impacts of the CBY Schism on Yemen’s Banking Sector.”  Written for the Yemen International Forum 2022, the brief examines how the rivalry between Yemen’s two central banks has fractured the banking sector, created dual currencies, politicized import financing and accelerated the growth of informal financial networks.  It offers targeted recommendations for bridging the divide and protecting banks from the wider war economy.  This summary contextualizes the brief within the financial‑banking series and updates the cumulative knowledge log.

Key findings and chronology

1. Roots of the crisis
	•	Cash‑based economy and pre‑war vulnerabilities:  Before 2014 Yemen had a largely cash‑based economy.  Banks invested customer deposits mainly in treasury bills and sukuk due to a lack of viable private‑sector opportunities .  When the war escalated in 2014–15, oil exports (the CBY’s main foreign‑currency source) halted and the CBY implemented capital controls, eroding trust in banks .  Wealthy Yemenis shifted funds to informal networks, leading to a severe liquidity crisis by mid‑2016 .  In September 2016 President Hadi relocated the CBY headquarters to Aden, creating two rival institutions: the Houthi‑aligned CBY‑Sana’a retained the infrastructure and staff, while the internationally recognised CBY‑Aden held international recognition .  Both branches suspended payments on public debt, turning bank‑held treasury bills into stranded assets .
	•	Islamization and debt conversion:  In August 2019 the CBY‑Sana’a froze interest accumulation on treasury bills and in September 2022 approved a draft law banning interest‑based transactions .  The proposal would convert more than YR1.7 trillion of treasury bills into non‑cash balances, a move toward Islamizing the financial system that risks intensifying banks’ liquidity crunch and undermines their solvency .

2. Divergent monetary policies and dual currencies
	•	CBY‑Aden monetary expansion vs. CBY‑Sana’a bans:  Beginning in 2017 the CBY‑Aden issued large volumes of new rials to cover public salaries and budget deficits .  This recurrent monetary expansion spurred exchange rate volatility and depreciation .  In response, Houthi authorities sought to weaponise monetary policy: between 2017 and 2019 they targeted traders using new banknotes  and, in January 2020, officially banned new rials in Houthi‑controlled areas .  This created two monetary zones: old rials in the north remained stable around YR560–YR604/US$1 , while new rials in government areas fluctuated wildly between YR800 and YR1,700/US$1 .
	•	Exchange rate arbitrage and speculation:  Money exchangers in Houthi areas exploited exchange‑rate differences to arbitrage profits .  The CBY‑Aden attempted to stabilise the market by launching weekly foreign‑currency auctions in November 2021, earmarking US dollars for qualified banks to finance basic imports .  However, inconsistent foreign‑currency supply and continued monetary expansion kept the rial volatile .

3. Politicization of letters of credit and SWIFT access
	•	Import financing leverage:  The CBY‑Aden’s control over the SWIFT network and the Saudi deposit allowed it to reopen letters of credit (LCs) for essential imports in 2018 .  It required banks to deposit collateral in physical rials to obtain foreign currency, which CBY‑Sana’a tried to circumvent by mandating non‑cash payments .  In November 2022 CBY‑Aden mandated that banks participating in foreign‑currency auctions share operations data to comply with AML/CFT requirements and to access US$300 million in IMF Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) .  The Fed insisted on semi‑annual assessments; banks needed CBY‑Aden certificates to maintain correspondent relationships  .
	•	Houthi response and geographical division:  Houthi authorities warned banks against sharing data and in mid‑January 2023 banned traders from conducting transactions with four local banks (three headquartered in Aden) and prohibited them from receiving FX from CBY‑Aden auctions .  This created a de facto geographical divide over the LC scheme, deepening the banking schism.  The Sana’a CBY issued circulars forbidding participation in CBY‑Aden auctions under the guise of preventing hard‑currency smuggling .

4. Rise of informal financial networks
	•	Expansion of hawala and money exchangers:  With banks constrained by the schism and liquidity shortages, traders increasingly turned to money exchangers and hawala networks, which have proliferated and now handle billions of dollars in domestic and international transfers .  These unregulated networks magnify currency instability through speculation  and pose high risks for money laundering and financing illicit activities .  The growth of informal finance reflects the erosion of trust in formal banks that began in 2016 and has accelerated since.

5. Renewed foreign‑currency support and prospects for mediation
	•	Fresh injections of funds:  In late 2022 and early 2023 Yemen received significant foreign‑currency support: US$300 million in IMF SDRs, US$1 billion from the Arab Monetary Fund (financed by Saudi Arabia) and nearly US$300 million from the UAE .  Saudi Arabia announced an additional US$1 billion deposit in February 2023 .  This assistance allowed CBY‑Aden to continue weekly currency auctions despite Houthi attacks halting oil exports .  However, by designating the Houthis as a terrorist group and planning to sanction banks tied to them, the government risks politicising the banking sector further【545337061728124†L320-L405】.
	•	Recommendations for focused interventions:  The brief argues that broad reconciliation is unrealistic; instead, stakeholders should pursue targeted measures to slow the entrenchment of parallel monetary systems and lay groundwork for technical coordination .  The main recommendations include:
	•	Prevent disqualification from CBY‑Aden auctions: Develop a compromise on data sharing to shield the banking sector from the wider conflict and strengthen AML/CFT compliance .
	•	Restart financial flows and address liquidity: Use a portion of foreign‑currency auction proceeds or SDR support to pay public sector salaries and release foreign‑exchange balances stranded at the CBY.  In return, CBY‑Sana’a should allow data sharing .
	•	Release BIS portfolio: If SDRs are not available, liquidate CBY’s estimated US$270 million portfolio at the BIS through a joint agreement .
	•	Ensure banks are not weaponized: The government should remove banks from its blacklist plans against the Houthis and the Houthis should stop coercive measures that isolate banks from global finance .

Analysis and takeaways
	1.	Deepening institutional schism:  This brief elucidates how the CBY split has permeated every aspect of Yemen’s financial system – from currency issuance and money‑supply management to import financing and anti‑money‑laundering compliance.  The creation of two currencies and conflicting regulations has entrenched economic fragmentation and fostered a lawless environment that benefits speculators and illicit networks.
	2.	Weaponization of regulatory tools:  Both CBY branches have used regulations as weapons.  The CBY‑Aden leverages control of SWIFT, auctions and foreign deposits to coerce compliance; CBY‑Sana’a uses its dominance in the banking geography to prohibit participation in Aden’s schemes.  The requirement for data sharing under AML/CFT compliance – an ostensibly technical measure – has become a battleground for sovereignty and surveillance.
	3.	Parallel to earlier warnings:  Earlier articles (2017–20) forecasted that the split would lead to divergent monetary policies and the spread of informal finance; this brief confirms those trends have materialised and deepened.  It connects the currency war (article 10) and data war (article 15) to a broader pattern of economic warfare, illustrating how each escalation builds on the last.
	4.	Policy realism:  Unlike earlier pieces that called for reunifying the central bank or sweeping reforms, this brief adopts a pragmatic approach.  It recognises that full reunification is unlikely in the current political climate and advocates for incremental steps: maintain auctions, pay salaries via banking channels, exchange data for liquidity, and ensure humanitarian funds are ring‑fenced.  This realism provides a pathway for stakeholders to stabilise the sector despite continuing conflict.

Events	2016 CBY relocation; 2019 freezing of interest; Jan 2020 ban on new rials; 2022 approval of Islamisation draft law; Nov 2022 data sharing requirement; Jan 2023 Houthi ban on banks using CBY‑Aden auctions; injection of foreign currency from IMF, AMF, Saudi Arabia and UAE; Houthi attacks on oil facilities and government’s terrorist designation; mid-2023 call for targeted interventions.	Adds to the chronology of the currency and data wars (articles 10 and 15). Highlights how external support (IMF, Gulf donors) intersects with domestic policies and how new designations (terrorist status) can further politicise the banking sector.
Policies & recommendations	Pragmatic suggestions: protect banks from exclusion, allocate auction funds to pay salaries, exchange data for liquidity, release BIS reserves, and keep banks off sanction lists .	These recommendations mark a shift from earlier broad calls to reunify the CBY (articles 7–8) toward incremental, technical steps. They also align with suggestions in article 12 to use SDRs prudently and article 10’s call for coordinated monetary policy.

Progress check on earlier recommendations

The brief shows that the major recommendations of earlier reports – reunifying the CBY, halting money printing, and restoring formal financial cycles – remain unfulfilled.  Instead, the schism has deepened with new regulations and the creation of two currencies.  There has been some progress: foreign‑currency auctions have mitigated volatility in government areas and new foreign support has arrived.  However, the data war (article 15) continues, and there is no unified monetary policy.  The targeted interventions proposed in this brief represent a shift from idealistic reforms to pragmatic crisis management.

Conclusion

The March 2023 policy brief “Bridging the Divide” provides the most comprehensive account to date of how Yemen’s banking schism has mutated into a fully fledged economic front in the war.  By documenting the emergence of dual currencies, the politicization of import financing and the explosive growth of informal finance, it highlights the urgency of shielding the banking sector from further weaponization.  Its recommendations emphasise focused, achievable steps – paying salaries through auctions, trading data for liquidity, and de‑politicising banks – as a way to slow Yemen’s economic fragmentation and maintain a foundation for future reconciliation.  Together with earlier reports, this analysis deepens our understanding of the complex interplay between monetary policy, financial regulation and humanitarian needs in the country’s ongoing conflict.
