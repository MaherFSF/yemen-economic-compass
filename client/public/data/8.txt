Yemen Economic Compass – Final Site Map & Developer Guide

Objective Review of Existing Concepts

The existing mock‑ups and documents (e.g., the mobile screenshot of the “بوابة البوصلة – المؤشرات الرئيسية” page, the master narrative and numerous reports) demonstrate a strong emphasis on real‑time data, clarity and bilingual presentation.  The key indicator cards displayed in the screenshot encapsulate statistics such as real GDP (vs 2014), inflation in different regions, exchange rates (Aden vs. Sana’a), government revenue, oil production, humanitarian funding, reserves, monetary supply, wages and sanctions intensity.  The cards use color‑coding (green/yellow/red) to convey status and severity.  Below the indicators, a text panel explains the data sources and methodology, while the footer contains navigation links, partner logos and contact information.

However, earlier drafts of the site map lacked depth in certain areas.  In particular, some actor categories were missing, the hierarchical relationships between pages were not explicit, and the plan for data ingestion and APIs remained generic.  The latest guidance and datasets (e.g., the Primary Datasets & API Endpoints document) provide much richer detail on required data sources, while the Yemen Economic Compass Master Dataset enumerates events, publications, stakeholders and banks that should be surfaced.  Incorporating these elements into a comprehensive blueprint will help developers build a cohesive, extensible platform.

Data Ingestion and API Plan

The Primary Datasets & API Endpoints document serves as a blueprint for data integration.  Key feeds include:
	•	Conflict and Event Data – Use ACLED for geocoded conflict events (requires a token); Yemen Data Project for airstrikes; UNVIM for port clearance reports; ReliefWeb/OCHA for access constraints; UN Panel of Experts reports for sanctions and finance networks.  When possible, fetch data via official APIs; otherwise schedule scrapes with human verification.
	•	Humanitarian & Population Data – Ingest funding flows from OCHA FTS via its API; IDP movements from IOM DTM (CKAN API); refugees and asylum data from UNHCR; food prices and minimum food basket from WFP VAM (HDX API); FEWS NET and WHO health reports via scraping.
	•	Economic Data – Pull macro‑economic series (GDP, poverty, external balance) from World Bank WDI using the country/indicator API; monetary and financial series (reserves, M2, CPI) from IMF SDMX services; oil production and exports from EIA/JODI (CSV downloads); exchange rate quotes from CBY bulletins and trusted market monitors.  Maintain both official and observed series and triangulate where necessary.
	•	Regulations & Standards – Harvest official documents (laws, circulars, budgets) from CBY Aden and Sana’a, MoF, tax and customs authorities, and the Central Statistics Organisation.  Use ReliefWeb and UNDOCs as fallback archives.
	•	Report Collections – Backfill 2011–2025 documents (HRPs, HNOs, sanction reports, economic updates, sector reports) via ReliefWeb, UNDOCs and agency portals.

Each dataset is stored with provenance (source and URL) and confidence scores, and the ingestion scripts record the vintage of the data (what was known at what time).  The ETL jobs should use checksums to ensure file integrity and support incremental updates.  For example, the ETL script for the OCHA FTS API should handle pagination and deduplicate flows; the script for the World Bank API should iterate over all indicators and use per_page=200 to fetch historical data.

Developer Instructions
	1.	Review the Excel Site Structure – The site_structure.xlsx file (attached) enumerates every page, its parent, description, data source, API status, expected visualisations and access level.  Use it as a hierarchical blueprint for routing and permissions.
	2.	Set Up the Data Model – Implement the database schema (actors, actor_metrics, indicators, events, sanctions, recommendations, documents, news).  Include soft‑delete, audit columns and provenance metadata.  Use Prisma or Drizzle for migrations.
	3.	Ingest the Master Dataset – Populate actors, events and literature tables from Yemen_Economic_Compass_MASTER_DATASET.xlsx.  This file includes 77 events, 52 publications, a timeline, key metrics and a list of banks & MFIs.  Map the actors to the categories defined in the Actors sheet of the site structure.
	4.	Configure API Connectors – Implement modules to fetch data from the World Bank, IMF, OCHA FTS, WFP VAM/HDX, JODI/EIA, UN sanctions lists, OFAC/EU sanctions, ACLED, UNVIM and other sources.  Adhere to rate limits and ensure authentication where required.  Schedule regular jobs (daily, weekly or monthly) depending on data frequency.
	5.	Develop Front‑End Components – Create reusable components for indicator cards, tables, charts, timelines, Sankey diagrams, calculators and network graphs.  Follow the design cues from the indicator page screenshot: color‑coded cards, clear labels and bilingual toggles.  Ensure RTL support for Arabic.
	6.	Implement the AI Layer – Build a retrieval‑augmented generation (RAG) pipeline: embed documents and metadata in a vector store, construct a knowledge graph connecting actors, indicators and events, and integrate a large language model tuned to the Yemen corpus.  Provide an API for the chat assistant, scenario simulator and recommendation engine.  The AI should cite sources in responses and adapt its weightings as new data arrives.
	7.	Role‑Based Access Control – Define user roles (public, donor/partner, government/regulator, financial institution, researcher/media, administrator) and assign permissions to pages and datasets.  Implement registration, login, password reset and subscription management.
	8.	Quality Assurance – Use unit and integration tests to validate ETL pipelines, API endpoints, and UI components.  Set up monitoring for data freshness, ETL failures, API errors, and AI response quality.  Use analytics to track user engagement and inform iterative improvements.
	9.	Documentation & Onboarding – Document the API endpoints, data schema, ingestion scripts, front‑end components and deployment processes.  Provide onboarding guides for administrators, content managers and data analysts.

Methodology, Citation & Standards Addendum

The user has requested additional features to ensure methodological transparency, rigorous sourcing and compliance with international standards.  These should be incorporated into the final build:

Methodology Documentation
	•	Create a dedicated Methodology page accessible from the main navigation.  This page must explain all analytic approaches used (e.g., econometric models, conflict event aggregation, scenario simulations) in clear language.  Include pop‑ups or tooltips throughout the site (via “What is this?” icons) that reveal methodology summaries when users hover over technical terms.
	•	Document the economic models powering the simulators.  For instance, describe the assumptions behind the FX simulator (e.g., liquidity supply, remittance flows) and the macro‑model linking oil revenues to GDP and poverty.
	•	Include data dictionaries for each dataset (see the DataDictionary sheet in the enhanced Excel file) and a Glossary page listing technical terms with bilingual definitions.
	•	Provide an Assumptions & Limitations section describing data gaps, proxy indicators and model constraints.

Source Attribution
	•	Add footnote anchors for every statistic and chart.  Each footnote should hyperlink to the original source (e.g., World Bank API, IMF reports, UN documents) and show the date fetched.
	•	Include inline citations within analysis texts (e.g., “according to the World Bank”) and a Sources section at the bottom of each page enumerating all references.
	•	Display a Last Updated timestamp and data vintage (the date when the data point was known) on every indicator and chart.

Adherence to International Standards
	•	IMF / World Bank – Use IMF country codes and classifications, adopt World Bank poverty line definitions ($2.15/day), implement fiscal indicators (debt/GDP, deficit/GDP), Doing Business metrics, balance‑of‑payments standards and governance indicators.
	•	OECD DAC – Apply DAC sector codes for aid tracking, DAC5 reporting standards, aid effectiveness principles and deflators for real‑term calculations; use the OECD Creditor Reporting System codes.
	•	IATI Transparency – Implement IATI activity identifiers, organisation codes, data quality standards, budget classifications and result indicators; provide an IATI XML export of aid data.
	•	Academic Citation – Allow users to export citations in APA, Chicago, Harvard and BibTeX formats; integrate with reference managers such as Zotero or Mendeley; include an “Export citation” button for each report.

Advanced Visualisation & Filters
	•	Support Sankey diagrams to display fund flows from donors to projects and beneficiaries.
	•	Create network graphs to visualise relationships between actors (donors, banks, political factions) and show influence networks.
	•	Implement heat maps for geographic analysis (e.g., humanitarian aid by governorate) and time‑series animations for indicators.
	•	Provide comparative charts to benchmark Yemen against regional peers and allow drill‑down into governorate or sector levels.
	•	Add multi‑select filters and date range pickers to all dashboards; implement advanced search with Boolean operators, saved queries and filter presets; and let users export filtered data to CSV/Excel.

Data Export & API Enhancements
	•	Offer CSV and Excel exports for all datasets; implement PDF report generation; allow charts to be saved as PNG/SVG; build a public API for researchers with proper documentation, rate limiting and API key management.

Performance & Accessibility
	•	Optimise performance: lazy‑load images, split code bundles, compress images (WebP), implement service workers for offline access, use skeleton loaders and aim for sub‑2 second load times on 3G connections.
	•	Ensure bilingual parity on every page; verify all links, images and downloads work in both languages.

World Bank Dedicated Journey

Develop a specialised /world-bank-journey page showcasing the Yemen Financial Market Infrastructure and Inclusion Project.  This should include:
	•	Project tracker: status, budget, timeline, implementing partners and disbursement milestones.
	•	Impact metrics: beneficiaries reached, sectors targeted and geographic distribution.
	•	A literature library filtered to World Bank‑related research and news feed tracking World Bank activities in Yemen.
	•	Dashboards of WB‑supported indicators (e.g., financial inclusion metrics), exportable reports and project cards summarising each initiative.
	•	Risk assessment dashboards, comparative analysis with World Bank projects in other fragile states and scenario simulators tailored to WB interventions.
	•	A policy recommendations section aligned with the World Bank mandate.

This addendum supplements the core developer guide and ensures that the final platform not only delivers comprehensive content but does so according to strict methodological, ethical and performance standards.

3.1 Home / Landing Page

The landing page introduces visitors to the purpose and scope of the Compass.  It summarises the key trends (GDP collapse, inflation divergence, dual currency systems, humanitarian funding gaps) with headlines and mini‑charts.  A timeline slider (2011–2025) highlights major turning points such as the 2016 central bank split and the currency ban .  Calls to action invite users to explore dashboards, register for an account or consult the AI analyst.

3.2 Dashboard Suite

The dashboard suite is a collection of interactive tools for visualising macro‑economic trends and crises.  Each module offers filters, time sliders and bilingual labels.
	1.	Compass Dashboard – Displays the 12 core indicators (FX rates in Aden and Sana’a, CPI North and South, GDP growth, minimum food basket price, oil output, humanitarian funding commitments, sanctions intensity, banking stress, remittances, foreign reserves and poverty).  Users can switch between line charts, bar charts and map overlays, and view data by region or actor.
	2.	Economic Crisis Explorer – Narrative pages explaining macro‑economic deterioration: GDP per capita has fallen by ~58% since 2015 and poverty has risen to ~76%.  Charts illustrate real income decline, inflation divergence and foreign reserves depletion.
	3.	Currency War Module – Visualises the dual currency system born after the CBY split.  It shows official vs. parallel exchange rates (e.g., 215 YER/USD in 2014 diverging to over 2 800 YER/USD by 2025) and maps where old vs. new notes circulate.
	4.	Cities Observatory – Offers city‑level dashboards (Aden, Sana’a, Hodeida, Marib, Taiz, etc.).  Each city page aggregates local prices, salaries, business activity, infrastructure damage and humanitarian needs.
	5.	Events & Shocks Timeline – A dynamic chronicle of macro‑events from 2011 onwards: CBY relocation, port blockades, introduction of import credit facility (e.g., Saudi deposit of $2 billion), SDR allocations, currency bans, fuel crises and major humanitarian appeals.  Users can click an event to see severity ratings, before/after indicator changes and related actors.
	6.	Investment & Climate Finance – Dedicated pages for green investment and climate adaptation.  Drawing inspiration from “Investment Magazine” and “Holm Akhder”, this section highlights renewable‑energy projects, climate‑finance flows, ESG opportunities and policy guidance.  It includes mapping of donors and investors, funding needs and case studies.
	7.	Youth & Social Initiatives (“Al Shabab”) – Showcases programmes by the Shabab House and microfinance networks to support youth entrepreneurship, training, job creation and community resilience.  This module provides success stories, funding opportunities and calls for collaboration.

3.3 Actor Hub (Stakeholder Microsites)

The Compass will host more than 100 actor‑specific microsites, each with bilingual profiles, metrics and cross‑linkages.  Data from the Bestever .xlsx workbook informs the structure below.
	•	Commercial Banks – Pages for each bank (CAC Bank, Tadhamon, Yemen Kuwait Bank, Islamic Bank of Yemen, etc.).  Each includes ownership, regional footprint, deposit base, branch network, humanitarian partner status, sanctions compliance and noteworthy events.  The notes from the workbook point out, for example, that CAC Aden manages government salary payments, Tadhamon is key for import letters of credit, and some banks relocated headquarters to Aden after the CBY split.
	•	Microfinance Institutions & Banks (MFIs/MFBs) – Profiles for MFIs (e.g., Al‑Amal, Aden Foundation, National Microfinance Foundation) and new microfinance banks (Al‑Kuraimi, Al‑Busairi, Al‑Qasimi).  Each page details licensing status, deposit accounts, micro‑lending products, technology adoption, opportunities and risks (e.g., rapid licensing outpacing regulatory capacity as highlighted in the microfinance slides).  Integration with the Yemen Microfinance Network (YMN) enables institutions to self‑update metrics and share success stories.
	•	Money Exchangers (Hawala) – Microsites for major exchangers such as Al Kuraimi, Al Swaid, Al Omgy, Al Akwa, Al Jamal and Al Raqi.  Pages list their network size, areas of operation, roles in remittance processing, aid distribution, trade finance and compliance (AML/KYC).  Notes from the slides emphasise that exchangers now process the bulk of remittances and domestic transactions, eclipsing banks.
	•	International Donors & IFIs – Profiles for the World Bank, IMF, OCHA, WFP, UNDP, USAID, Saudi Arabia, UAE and others.  Each page summarises funding commitments, programmes, policy positions, support for reforms and evaluation notes (e.g., IMF Article IV reports, FTS flows).  Users can track aid flows by sector and region.
	•	Regulatory & Government Entities – Pages for CBY Aden, CBY Sana’a, Ministries of Finance, SFD, SFD Microfinance Unit, taxation authorities.  Provide budgets, policy circulars, reserve data, currency issuance, tax laws and analyses of dual monetary zones.
	•	Military & Political Actors – Microsites for the internationally recognised government (IRG), Houthi de‑facto authorities, Southern Transitional Council (STC), Saudi‑led coalition and security forces.  Pages discuss their political control, economic governance, sanctions status, and impact on finance (e.g., currency bans, blockade decisions).  Use the sanctions sheet from the workbook to track UNSC 2140 designations and OFAC penalties.
	•	Business Groups – Profiles for conglomerates like the Hayel Saeed Anam (HSA) group, Bin Mahfouz group and others.  Each page summarises their holdings (food imports, manufacturing, telecoms, banking), employment impact, philanthropic activities and controversies (e.g., HSA received 48% of Saudi letter‑of‑credit subsidies but claims to have cut food prices; such context comes from the slide on business groups).
	•	Knowledge & Civil Society – Pages for Sana’a Center, ACAPS, Chatham House, ODI, IGC and other think‑tanks.  Each summarises their research focus and major publications.
	•	Sanctions & Cross‑Sector Portals – Lists of individuals and entities under international sanctions, with details of designations and compliance requirements; plus links to cross‑sector portals like the WFP and OCHA data hubs.

Each actor microsite includes: a summary overview, time‑series graphs of relevant metrics, key events affecting the actor, relationships to other actors (via the knowledge graph), and a list of publications or regulations.  Authorized users (e.g., banks or donors) can edit certain fields.

3.4 Indicators & Data Pages

Separate pages describe each tracked indicator: definition, formula, frequency, data sources, and significance.  For example, the Inflation (CPI) – Aden page defines CPI, explains the difference between Aden and Sana’a inflation, lists data sources (CBY reports, WFP food basket data) and provides interactive charts with region and timeframe filters.  Each indicator page links to events and actors influencing it (e.g., CBY policy decisions, currency bans) and lists limitations or caveats (e.g., parallel market distortions).

3.5 Data Sources & References

A data catalogue page enumerates all data sources.  Each entry specifies the provider, description, metrics available, API endpoints or download links, update frequency and notes on use.  For instance, OCHA FTS provides humanitarian funding flows by sector and donor; the World Bank API yields GDP and poverty data; the CBY Aden FX Auction API returns daily auctions results; IMF IFS provides reserves and monetary aggregates.  This transparency helps users understand provenance and fosters trust.

3.6 Knowledge Graph & Memory

At the core of the AI system is a knowledge graph that connects actors, indicators, events and sources.  The graph is stored in a graph database (e.g., Neo4j) and includes nodes for each actor, indicator and event, with edges representing relationships (e.g., “funds”, “regulates”, “imports”, “sanctioned by”).  Time‑stamped edges allow users to trace how relationships evolve.  A memory layer stores documents and transcripts with embeddings for semantic search.

An interactive visualization lets users explore this graph: clicking on an actor reveals connected events and indicators; filters allow users to view only humanitarian flows or sanctions networks.  The graph also powers the AI analyst, enabling contextual retrieval.

3.7 AI Analyst, Scenario Simulators & Recommendation Engine
	1.	AI Chat Assistant – A bilingual conversational interface that uses retrieval‑augmented generation (RAG).  When a user asks a question, the system retrieves relevant documents and data from the knowledge graph and summarises them in natural language while citing sources.  The assistant can answer simple queries (“What caused the rial to depreciate in 2025?”) and complex ones (“How would cancelling fuel subsidies affect inflation and poverty?”).  It uses open‑source large language models fine‑tuned on Yemen’s corpus, with safeguards to avoid hallucination.  Every answer includes citations to underlying documents and indicates confidence.
	2.	Scenario Simulators & Model Tools – These modules allow users to explore “what‑if” scenarios.  Users can adjust assumptions (e.g., humanitarian funding levels, exchange‑rate paths, oil prices, remittance inflows) and see simulated effects on indicators.  Under the hood, the platform uses simplified macroeconomic models and machine‑learning regressions, trained on historical data, to approximate relationships.  For example, a user can ask: What happens to poverty and inflation if remittances drop by 20%?  The simulator draws on the knowledge graph to highlight related actors and events.
	3.	Recommendation Engine – Based on the simulation outputs and past interventions, the engine suggests policy options.  For instance, if high inflation persists, it may recommend unifying auctions across currency zones or introducing targeted cash transfers, citing previous experiences and research findings.  The engine is customisable per user type: donors receive recommendations on funding allocations; central bank officials receive monetary policy scenarios; MFIs receive guidance on sustainable lending practices.

3.8 Resources & Library

This repository contains documents, reports, regulations and literature relevant to the Yemeni economy.  It includes PDFs, presentations (e.g., the “Yemen’s Economic Crisis” report, the “Master Narrative”, “Yemen’s Fragmented Financial Landscape” slides and other uploaded files), laws, policy briefs, and articles.  Users can search by keyword, date, organisation or sector.  Each document is stored with metadata and tags, and the AI assistant uses this library to cite information in answers.

3.9 User Management & Subscription

The platform supports multiple user roles with Role‑Based Access Control (RBAC):
	•	Public Users – Anonymous visitors can view aggregated dashboards, read narrative pages and access most actor profiles.  They can create an account to save favourite charts or subscribe to newsletters.
	•	Donor & Partner Accounts – International donors, UN agencies and NGO partners gain access to detailed funding dashboards, micro‑level data, report downloads and scenario simulators.  They can upload project data and get analytics on impact.
	•	Government & Regulators – Officials from CBY Aden, CBY Sana’a, ministries and oversight bodies have rights to review sensitive datasets (e.g., bank balance sheets, licensing status) and update events or actor profiles.  They can receive AI‑generated briefs tailored to their mandates (e.g., a governor can ask, “What are the implications of issuing new rials this quarter?”).
	•	Financial Institutions & Businesses – Banks, MFIs, exchangers and business groups can update their own pages, submit financial statements, track compliance and compare themselves to peers.  The system can alert them to regulatory changes or market shifts.
	•	Researchers & Media – Academics and journalists can access full datasets, download CSVs, and query the knowledge graph via an API.  They can also request custom analyses.
	•	Site Owner / Administrator – Has full control to manage users, moderate content, approve changes, configure data pipelines and oversee security.  The admin dashboard shows system health, data ingestion status and AI training metrics.

Subscription plans can include a free tier (public data), a professional tier (expanded dashboards, scenario tools, document library) and an enterprise tier (custom analytics, dedicated support and API access).

3.10 Development API and Data Ingestion

To ensure continuous updates, the platform offers a RESTful API.  Developers can call endpoints to retrieve time‑series data, actor profiles, event lists and document metadata.  The API also supports bulk data uploads for authorised entities (e.g., CBY reports).  Documentation includes sample requests and response schemas.

Data ingestion occurs via connectors to external APIs (World Bank, IMF, OCHA FTS, WFP) and manual uploads for local data.  ETL scripts validate and normalise data, compute indicators and store them in the relational database.  A data provenance framework logs source, timestamp and user.  Cron jobs schedule updates, and triggers propagate changes to dashboards and the AI memory so that new data automatically appears in charts and answers.

4. AI & Data Processing Architecture

The Intelligence Engine follows a four‑layer approach: collect, analyse, reason and explain.
	1.	Collection Layer – Scrapes and fetches data from whitelisted sources (CBY reports, WFP price monitors, FTS funding flows, etc.) and ingests them into the database.  Manual entry forms allow the platform team to input qualitative insights and event descriptions.  The system assigns a confidence score to each data point based on source reliability and recency.
	2.	Analysis Layer – Transforms raw data into structured metrics and indicators, calculates trends and anomalies and stores them in actor_metrics and indicators.  Natural‑language processing extracts facts from reports and tags them with entities and time periods.  Data quality checks flag inconsistencies.
	3.	Reasoning Layer – The knowledge graph connects actors, indicators and events to enable reasoning about cause and effect.  When new data is ingested (e.g., a spike in FX rate), the graph identifies related events (e.g., a currency ban) and actors (CBY, exchangers), updating connections and recalculating influence weights.  Machine‑learning models (e.g., embedding models for text, and econometric models for forecasting) power the scenario simulators and recommendation engine.
	4.	Explanation Layer – The AI analyst interprets the underlying analysis and reasoning to answer user questions in natural language, with footnotes and citations.  It includes an English–Arabic translation layer to support bilingual responses.

5. Implementation Strategy

Technology Stack – Use Next.js or another React framework for the front‑end; Fastify/Express for the API layer; PostgreSQL for relational storage; Neo4j or an equivalent graph database for the knowledge graph; and a vector database (e.g., Pinecone or pgvector) for storing document embeddings.  Host the application on a scalable cloud platform (AWS, Azure or DigitalOcean).  Employ CI/CD pipelines and containerization (Docker) for deployment.  Implement bilingual UI with right‑to‑left support for Arabic.

Security & Compliance – Implement authentication (OAuth2/JWT), RBAC, and encryption of data at rest and in transit.  Ensure compliance with GDPR and Yemeni data regulations.  Provide audit logs and user activity tracking.

Performance & Scalability – Use caching (Redis) for frequently accessed data, asynchronous tasks for heavy computations, and database replication.  Optimise queries with indices and partitions.

Monitoring & Maintenance – Set up monitoring tools (Prometheus/Grafana) to track uptime, API latency, data ingestion health and AI performance.  Create internal dashboards for administrators to review data pipelines, flagged errors and content moderation queues.

Design Inspiration – The platform should adopt clean, modern design principles inspired by leading economic dashboards (e.g., World Bank DataBank, IMF DataMapper) but with localised branding.  Colour schemes should differentiate between the two monetary zones (e.g., green for Aden, blue for Sana’a) and highlight key metrics.  Responsive design ensures accessibility on mobile devices, as seen in the mobile filter UI from the uploaded image.

6. Next Steps
	1.	Validate the Site‑Map – Review this enhanced site‑map with stakeholders and refine the hierarchy.  Agree on the list of actors to feature first (banks, MFIs, exchangers, donors) and prioritise indicators.
	2.	Gather & Clean Data – Use the workbook and uploaded PDFs to populate initial actor profiles and indicator series.  Confirm access to external APIs and start building ingestion scripts.  Engage with CBY, YMN and donors to obtain up‑to‑date data from 2011–2025.
	3.	Prototype Dashboards – Develop wireframes for each dashboard module.  Use sample data to test interactivity, filtering and bilingual display.  Iterate based on user feedback.
	4.	Build the Knowledge Graph – Model relationships between actors, indicators and events.  Import documents into the vector database and build semantic search.
	5.	Develop the AI Analyst – Fine‑tune language models on the curated corpus.  Integrate retrieval pipelines and test the scenario simulator.  Ensure the assistant cites sources appropriately.
	6.	Implement RBAC & User Flows – Define user roles and create registration, login, subscription and password‑reset flows.  Set up admin dashboards for content and user management.
	7.	Pilot & Iterate – Release a closed beta to a small group of donors, regulators and researchers.  Collect feedback on usability, data accuracy and AI responses.  Adjust dashboards, data models and AI prompts accordingly.

1. Global Principles for Roles & Permissions
	1.	Strict neutrality & do‑no‑harm
	•	The platform never takes sides between Yemeni or regional actors.
	•	All pages are factual, sourced, and carefully worded, especially when describing conflict parties, sanctions, or sensitive incidents.
	2.	One data brain, many “lenses”
	•	All roles read from the same validated datasets (events, indicators, actors, banks, sanctions, aid, laws).
	•	The difference between roles is:
	•	which parts are highlighted,
	•	what tools they can use (simulators, custom queries, uploads),
	•	what they can export or annotate.
	3.	Role‑based access (RBAC)
	•	Implement roles as groups in the auth system (e.g. AWS Cognito user groups + IAM roles).
	•	Each protected API (API Gateway + Lambda / RDS) checks:
	•	role (what can this user do?),
	•	actor_type (e.g. “commercial bank”, “UN agency”),
	•	tier (Public / Standard / Professional / Partner / Owner).
	4.	English first, Arabic in parallel
	•	All roles and screens are fully available in English.
	•	Every role’s journey will later have mirrored Arabic content; language toggle is always visible.
	5.	Per‑role “Compass Agent”
	•	Each major persona gets a dedicated AI assistant embedded in their workspace.
	•	Same core knowledge base; different:
	•	pre‑set focus (macroeconomy, sanctions, banking, humanitarian, etc.),
	•	default questions,
	•	level of technical language vs. plain explanations,
	•	safeguards (e.g. no operationally sensitive suggestions).
