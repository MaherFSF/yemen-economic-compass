1. Why Yemen’s Financial Crisis Is Different

Yemen is not just facing a “weak economy”; it is living through a deliberate, prolonged unmaking of its monetary and financial system. After a decade of war, the country has:
	•	Two rival central banks since 2016, neither of which can fully perform the role of a modern monetary authority.  
	•	A banking sector that has lost public confidence, carries large non-performing assets, and operates under conflicting regulations and political pressure.  
	•	A rapidly expanding informal financial sector—money exchangers, remittance networks, and microfinance banks—now handling a large share of day-to-day payments, salary transfers, and aid flows.  

The result is a fragmented monetary space in which cash, electronic balances, and multiple exchange rates circulate side by side, with no single actor able to stabilize prices, anchor expectations, or steer credit toward productive activity.

This is the core of Yemen’s economic crisis: a broken financial plumbing system that amplifies every other shock—conflict dynamics, food import costs, climate impacts, and governance failures—into deeper poverty and instability.

⸻

2. Central Bank Fragmentation and the Banking Squeeze

Until 2016, Yemen’s Central Bank (CBY) was perceived as relatively independent by local standards and played a stabilizing role, including salary payments across frontlines.   After the decision to relocate CBY from Sana’a to Aden and the subsequent institutional split, at least four dynamics accelerated the crisis:
	1.	Frozen or impaired legacy deposits and public debt
	•	Both rival CBYs took decisions that effectively locked in pre-war deposits and government securities. In Sana’a, interest on rolled-over treasury bills was booked into non-redeemable accounts; in Aden, new instruments were issued while banks’ ability to realize value from older holdings was constrained.  
	•	For banks and depositors, this meant that a large part of their balance sheets became illiquid or politically contested.
	2.	Regulatory and operational warfare
	•	Competing regulations, duplicated oversight, and conflicting instructions on reserve requirements, FX rules, and bank relocation created a patchwork environment. Some banks were threatened with license revocation or disconnection from SWIFT depending on which side they complied with.  
	•	This increased transaction costs and legal risk, discouraging intermediation and pushing flows to less regulated channels.
	3.	Liquidity and confidence collapse
	•	Liquidity shocks and foreign currency scarcity led to withdrawal limits, especially in FX, and eroded trust in formal banks.  
	•	Households and businesses responded by hoarding cash, shifting to exchangers, or moving savings abroad where possible.
	4.	Monetary tools without a functioning transmission channel
	•	Policy moves—such as new banknotes in Aden and e-money initiatives in Sana’a—were deployed into a system where banks no longer sat at the center of payments and credit.  
	•	That weakened any remaining ability of either CBY to influence inflation, credit conditions, or exchange rate expectations.

The net effect is a “de-banked” economy: banks still exist on paper and are important for external trade documentation and some government functions, but the real circulation of money has migrated elsewhere.

⸻

3. The Rise of Informal Finance and Microfinance Banks

As trust in traditional banks eroded, money exchange companies, remittance operators, and microfinance banks moved to fill the gap. Two overlapping trends stand out:
	1.	Expansion of informal and semi-formal payment networks
	•	Informal financial institutions and agents now provide a large share of basic financial services—domestic remittances, salary distribution, cash-in/cash-out for aid, and trade payments.  
	•	Remittances—already vital before the war—have become even more important for macro-stability and household survival.  
	2.	Transformation of exchangers into microfinance banks (MFBs)
	•	Regulatory reforms made it relatively easier for money exchange companies to convert into licensed microfinance banks, able to take deposits and offer a wider range of services.  
	•	Competition between the rival CBYs has reportedly accelerated the granting of MFB licenses, sometimes without comprehensive planning or prudential capacity to supervise them.  

This carries both opportunity and risk:
	•	On the positive side, MFBs can reach segments long ignored by commercial banks—micro-enterprises, rural clients, and women entrepreneurs—using lighter infrastructure and mobile tools.  
	•	On the risk side, rapid, uncoordinated licensing in a fragmented regulatory space, with limited credit information and weak risk management, can lead to over-indebtedness, mission drift, and systemic vulnerabilities.  

Yemen now has a hybrid financial ecosystem where:
	•	Banks remain critical for letters of credit, external payments, and public sector operations.
	•	Exchange houses and MFBs handle much of the daily circulation of money, especially for poorer and conflict-affected communities.
	•	Electronic wallets, e-Rial schemes, and proprietary payment platforms exist, but in a fragmented way, often tied to specific political or commercial actors.  

Without a unified regulatory and supervisory architecture, this ecosystem can easily tip from “adaptive” to “chaotic.”

⸻

4. Digital, Trade, and Climate Shocks: Stress Multipliers

The financial crisis sits on top of other structural stressors:
	1.	Digital and e-commerce constraints
	•	Yemen has one of the weakest internet infrastructures globally. Only about 17.7 percent of the population was online in 2024.  
	•	The country remains heavily cash-based, with underdeveloped digital payment systems, limited consumer protection, and almost no coherent regulatory framework for e-commerce.  
	•	This severely limits the ability of micro and small enterprises to leverage online markets, digital finance, or cross-border services.
	2.	Climate vulnerability with minimal climate finance
	•	Yemen is acutely vulnerable to climate shocks—droughts, irregular rainfall, floods, and cyclones—that are already undermining water security, agriculture, and urban systems.  
	•	Yet Yemen has received only about US$0.60 per capita in adaptation finance between 2015 and 2021, far below more stable countries that receive over US$100 per capita.  
	•	Fragmented institutions, lack of accredited national entities, and limited data further restrict access to climate-related funds.  
	3.	SDG regression and social strain
	•	Globally, only 17 percent of SDG targets are on track, with significant regression on poverty, hunger, and inequality; fragile, conflict-affected countries like Yemen are among the hardest hit.  
	•	This macro backdrop means Yemen is competing for scarce concessional finance in an environment where many other countries can demonstrate more stable governance and implementation capacity.

In short, Yemen faces a convergence of digital exclusion, climate stress, and financial fragmentation. Each one reinforces the others and makes standard “reform recipes” inadequate unless they directly tackle the monetary and financial core.

⸻

5. Where Policy and Assistance Need to Shift

Given this landscape, incremental tweaks are not enough. Any serious strategy for Yemen’s economic recovery and financial stabilization needs to organize around five interlocking priorities:

5.1. Re-establish a Functional, Credible Monetary Authority
	•	Medium-term objective: A single, technically credible central bank with unified balance sheets, clear legal foundations, and a realistic mandate.
	•	Short-term steps, even before political settlement:
	•	Negotiated technical arrangements between the two CBYs on:
	•	Payment system interoperability;
	•	Data sharing;
	•	Minimum prudential standards that apply across frontlines.
	•	Third-party facilitated working groups (with IMF, World Bank, UN or others in a technical, non-political role) focused on liquidity management, FX rules, and public debt treatment.  

The test is simple: does each new step increase or reduce fragmentation and uncertainty for depositors and firms?

5.2. Put Microfinance Banks on a Sustainable Track
	•	Impose a temporary pause on new MFB licenses until a joint risk assessment is done and a minimum supervisory framework is agreed.  
	•	Encourage consolidation and responsible growth rather than uncontrolled proliferation; incentivize MFBs that:
	•	Serve rural and low-income clients;
	•	Maintain strong risk management and transparent pricing;
	•	Integrate with credit information systems as they emerge.  
	•	Support MFBs and MFIs with targeted TA on digital finance, climate-resilient lending (e.g. water-saving agriculture, solar), and consumer protection.

This is where Yemen can realistically expand financial inclusion without pretending that commercial banks will suddenly return to pre-war models.

5.3. Build a Coherent Digital Payments and E-Commerce Framework
	•	Focus first on foundations: digital ID, basic interoperability standards, and consumer protection for e-money and wallets, rather than flashy one-off platforms.  
	•	Align CBY regulations, telecom authorities, and competition rules so that digital payment rails are:
	•	Safe (AML/CFT, data protection);
	•	Accessible (low-cost, low-bandwidth options);
	•	Neutral (not captured by a single political or commercial actor).
	•	Use the roll-out of satellite internet (e.g. Starlink) strategically in underserved areas, with safeguards around security, licensing, and affordability.  

The immediate goal is not sophisticated fintech; it is low-friction, low-cost, conflict-aware digital rails that can carry remittances, social protection, and small business payments.

5.4. Secure Dedicated Windows for Climate and Resilience Finance
	•	Advocate—through regional blocs and UN channels—for simplified accreditation and tailored climate-finance access rules for conflict-affected LDCs like Yemen, where conventional institutional pre-conditions are unrealistic in the short term.  
	•	Develop a national climate finance task force (with representation from both sides where feasible) to:
	•	Prioritize no-regrets adaptation investments (water, agriculture, flood protection);
	•	Prepare programmatic pipelines that can fit GCF, Adaptation Fund, and MDB facilities;
	•	Ensure that climate projects strengthen, not bypass, local financial institutions and data systems.  

Climate money should not become another fragmented parallel system; it should reinforce the long-term resilience of Yemen’s financial architecture.

5.5. Design Aid and Social Protection to Work With the Financial System, Not Around It
	•	Humanitarian and development agencies should treat the structure of payment channels as a core program variable, not a logistical afterthought.  
	•	Wherever feasible, use and strengthen regulated entities (banks, MFBs, licensed PSPs) rather than purely ad hoc cash systems, while avoiding political capture or exclusion of populations across frontlines.
	•	Embed impact and localization metrics in aid programming (e.g. genuine scores of impact, gender and social inclusion, and financial-sector spillover indicators), and use them to adjust delivery mechanisms over time.  

Done well, aid flows can help rebuild trust in safe financial channels; done badly, they deepen reliance on opaque intermediaries and distort competition.

6. Closing Frame

Yemen’s economic and financial crisis is not an accounting problem; it is an institutional and political one, expressed through monetary fragmentation and financial dislocation.

Any serious effort—whether led by Yemeni actors, donors, IFIs, or the private sector—must start from a simple recognition:

If the pipes carrying money remain broken, every other intervention will leak.

Re-stitching Yemen’s monetary space, stabilizing and modernizing its financial ecosystem, and tying that ecosystem to digital, trade, and climate agendas is not a secondary technical exercise; it is one of the main conditions for any durable recovery.

This note is meant as a living analysis: a baseline narrative to refine with Yemen-specific data, political developments, and sectoral inputs. But the direction of travel is clear—from fragmentation and informality toward managed pluralism, responsible inclusion, and a rebuilt monetary center that people can actually trust.

Perfect, let’s do this methodically and build the upgraded version into your existing note step by step.

I’ll treat your current piece:

“Yemen’s Economic and Financial Crisis – Working Analysis Note”

as the base, and for each new element I’ll give you:
	1.	Exact text / table / box content
	2.	Clear instruction: where to insert it in your current draft
	3.	Any short notes to designer (for visuals)

I’ll cover everything I suggested earlier: thesis box, 3-phase framing, sidebars, tables, visuals, and scenario matrix.

⸻

A. FRONT MATTER UPGRADES

A1. Add a “Thesis Box” after the title

Where to insert it

Right after the main title block and before your current opening paragraph that starts with something like “Yemen is not just facing a ‘weak economy’…”.

⸻

Insert this box as a shaded callout:

Core Thesis – In Four Lines
	•	Yemen has not experienced a simple “banking collapse”; it has lived through a decade-long reconfiguration of who actually moves money.
	•	The formal monetary center (the central bank and commercial banks) lost control, while informal and semi-formal networks – exchangers, remittance houses, microfinance banks – quietly became the spine of the economy.
	•	Every major external decision (central bank relocation, salary policies, humanitarian cash, sanctions, climate and development finance rules) has unintentionally picked winners and losers inside this shadow architecture.
	•	The next decade will not be decided by “rebuilding banks” alone, but by how Yemen’s monetary core is rewired to integrate, regulate, and discipline the system that already exists in practice.

⸻

A2. Reframe the opening as a 3-phase journey

You already explain why Yemen’s crisis is different. We keep that substance but structure the first half of the note around three phases.

Where to change

Take your current “Section 1” (or first 3–4 paragraphs) and adapt it to this structure:

⸻

Replace your first section heading with:

1. Ten Years of Unmaking the Monetary Center (2015–2025)

Then insert this short bridge paragraph immediately under that heading:

Over the last decade, Yemen’s financial system did not simply weaken; it went through three distinct phases of dismantling and improvisation. Each phase reshaped who holds liquidity, who clears payments, and who ordinary people trust with their money.

Then insert three sub-subsections like this:

1.1 2015–2017 — Shock and Improvisation
	•	Outbreak of large-scale war and external military intervention.
	•	Rapid fiscal collapse, arrears, and disruptions to salary payments.
	•	Central Bank of Yemen (CBY) starts to lose its role as a neutral paymaster and anchor of expectations.
	•	Liquidity dries up in branches; people begin to rely more heavily on cash on hand, local exchangers, and remittance agents.
	•	Humanitarian actors arrive in scale but still default to bank-centric channels where possible, even as banks themselves are struggling.

1.2 2018–2020 — Consolidation of the Workaround
	•	Institutional split of the CBY and deepening political contestation over who is “the” monetary authority.
	•	Conflicting regulations, duplicated oversight, and competing banknote policies harden geographic and political lines in the monetary space.
	•	Commercial banks become increasingly risk-averse, accumulate illiquid government paper and frozen deposits, and cede day-to-day payments to exchangers.
	•	Remittances and humanitarian cash both expand and begin to run more systematically through hawala networks and large money exchange houses.
	•	Early microfinance banks and digital pilots appear, but on top of a system already skewed toward informal rails.

1.3 2021–2025 — Normalization of the Informal
	•	Two rival CBYs operate in parallel, each issuing instructions, licenses, and enforcement threats. Neither fully controls the national monetary circuit.
	•	Licensing of microfinance banks and payment service providers accelerates, often without a consolidated prudential vision. Former exchangers turn into quasi-banks with wide geographic reach.
	•	For households, traders, and even many NGOs, exchangers and MFBs become the default interface with the financial system; banks are used for specific formalities (letters of credit, some payroll, donor requirements) but no longer sit at the center.
	•	Digital wallets and proprietary payment platforms emerge in pockets, but in fragmented ways tied to specific political actors, telecoms, or conglomerates.
	•	By mid-2020s, the “workaround” is no longer temporary: it is the system. The strategic question is how to discipline and rewire it, not how to roll back time to 2014.

Now your existing detailed analysis (CBY fragmentation, banking squeeze, rise of microfinance, etc.) can sit after 1.3, as deeper dives into these phases.

B. SIDE BARS & MICRO-STORIES

B1. Sidebar: “What Outsiders Get Wrong”

Where to insert

Place this as a callout box right after the section where you first explain the CBY split and banking disintermediation (after your current “Central Bank Fragmentation and the Banking Squeeze” subsection).

⸻

Box content:

Three Persistent Misconceptions About Yemen’s Financial System

1. “The financial system collapsed.”
It did not collapse; it re-routed. The formal pipes (central bank + commercial banks) are badly damaged, but money still moves – just increasingly through exchangers, MFBs, and informal networks that do not appear on standard financial stability dashboards.

2. “Hawala is a temporary workaround.”
It used to be a bridge over banking gaps. Over the past decade, it has become the main bridge, road, and rail combined for domestic payments, remittances, salaries in many areas, and humanitarian cash. Any credible reform must deal with hawala as infrastructure, not an anomaly.

3. “Fix the central bank and everything else will follow.”
A functioning, credible monetary authority is indispensable – but, on its own, insufficient. Without re-aligning incentives around aid delivery, remittance corridors, licensing, and digital rails, central bank reforms will struggle to reach the real economy, because the transmission channel has been rewired elsewhere.

⸻

B2. Micro-Lens Story: “One Merchant, 2014 vs 2024”

Where to insert

Place this story near the start of your section on “The Rise of Informal Finance and Microfinance Banks”, as a short narrative break.

⸻

Text:

Micro-Lens: A Taiz Trader, Then and Now

In 2014, a mid-sized trader in Taiz imported food and basic goods using a straightforward chain:
	•	He held a current account with a commercial bank,
	•	Opened a letter of credit for his shipment,
	•	Settled with his supplier through the bank’s correspondent in the Gulf,
	•	Paid staff and transporters in cash drawn from that same account.

In 2024, the same trader still imports, but his financial life is unrecognizable:
	•	His formal bank account exists, but is barely used – he distrusts withdrawal limits, FX controls, and the risk of funds being trapped.
	•	He sources currency through a trusted exchanger corridor, sometimes pre-paying in Riyal or USD cash to secure a shipment.
	•	For local payments, he relies on a mix of hawala, mobile balances, and bare cash, juggling rates and fees across different cities and lines of control.
	•	Taxes, levies, and “service fees” are often paid through designated intermediaries tied to local authorities rather than through the banking system.

His business survived, but at the cost of higher transaction risks, opaque pricing, and complete dependence on actors who do not appear as “banks” in any official statistics.

⸻

Table content:

Flow type	2014 (Baseline)	2018	2022	2025 (expected pattern, to refine)
Government salaries	Mostly via commercial banks, with cash payout at branches	Mixed: banks in some areas, exchangers and cash in contested or cut-off zones	Largely via exchangers, local authorities’ designated agents, or ad hoc mechanisms; banks handle limited segments	Continued heavy use of non-bank intermediaries; patchy bank-based payrolls in specific sectors/geographies
Humanitarian cash transfers	Limited; where present, often in-kind or vouchers with some bank interface	Major scale-up; agencies start using both banks and financial service providers (FSPs), including exchangers	FSP models mature; many agencies deliberately choose exchangers/MFBs over banks for reach and flexibility	Humanitarian design increasingly assumes a non-bank default, with banks involved mainly where donors or compliance require
Remittances (international)	Mix of banks and established money transfer operators; cash payout at major cities	Shift toward hawala and exchangers as trust in banks and access decline	Hawala/exchangers dominate, especially for smaller tickets; banks retain niche for larger, documented transfers	Hawala entrenched as primary remittance channel, with selective bank usage for specific senders and destinations
Trade finance (imports)	Bank-centric LCs and correspondent banking, especially via Gulf hubs	Banks still central for documentation but traders increasingly layer in exchangers for FX	Growing use of dual structures: banks for paperwork; exchangers/hawala for practical FX and settlements	Importers operate through complex hybrids; risk management depends on relationships with large financial intermediaries, often non-banks
Local business payments (B2B)	Cheques, bank transfers, and cash	Cash and exchanger-mediated transfers increasingly common	Predominantly cash, hawala, and internal transfer books of large exchangers/MFBs; limited formal bank transfers	Non-bank networks function as de facto clearinghouses for local B2B transactions

Title:

Table 3. Simplified View of Yemen’s Formal and Semi-Formal Financial Landscape

Because precise counts change and are politically sensitive, we keep it structural, not numeric:

Category	Pre-2015 situation	By around 2020	By mid-2020s (trend)
Commercial banks	Core of formal system; key for deposits, trade, and public sector	Still important for external trade and some payroll; weakened by illiquidity, arrears, and regulatory conflict	Niche but necessary for certain functions; not the primary interface for households or small firms
Islamic banks	Growing segment with specific clientele	Similar pressures as other banks; some maintain stronger retail relationships	Survive in niches; constrained by same macro and political risks as rest of sector
Microfinance banks (MFBs)	Small number; early stage; limited outreach	Noticeable expansion; some exchangers transform into MFBs; regulators encourage growth	Rapid proliferation; quality and risk management vary widely; mission drift and over-competition emerge as risks
Microfinance institutions (MFIs, non-bank)	Donor-linked, under Social Fund; focused on micro/small enterprises	Strained by conflict logistics and funding volatility	Remain relevant but overshadowed in visibility and scale by MFBs and larger exchangers
Money exchangers / hawala networks	Important but peripheral to “official” narrative	Become crucial to keeping the economy moving; many scale up	Function as backbone of the payment system for most households and many businesses
Digital / e-money providers	Almost negligible	Pilots and early products; limited interoperability	Expanding but fragmented; shaped heavily by politics, telecom ownership, and regulatory fragmentation

(You can refine dates and add rows from your own knowledge/files.)

Approx. date	Actor(s)	Decision / event	Immediate financial effect	Medium-term consequence
2016	Political authorities; CBY leadership	Decision to relocate CBY headquarters to Aden	Operational disruption; uncertainty over salary payments; split in staff and archives	De facto dual monetary authorities; competing claims over reserves, public debt, and regulatory power
2017–2018	Rival CBYs	Issuance of conflicting circulars (reserve requirements, FX rules, relocations)	Banks forced to navigate contradictory instructions; legal and compliance risk spikes	Banks retrench; more flows move through exchangers to avoid being caught between regulators
2018–2019	De facto authorities, local governments	New levies, fees, and security “charges” on trade and transport	Higher cost of moving goods and cash across frontlines	Growth of specialized corridors and intermediaries with political protection
2017–2020	Donors, UN agencies	Large-scale adoption of cash and voucher assistance	Need for fast, last-mile financial channels beyond formal banks	Aid becomes a stable revenue stream for FSPs and exchangers; reinforces their centrality
2020–2023	CBY branches, regulators	Waves of new licenses for MFBs and payment service providers	Rapid increase in number of lightly supervised entities	Elevated risk of mission drift, over-lending, and weak consumer protection; opportunity to expand inclusion if disciplined

You can add a row per big decision you care about (sanctions; trade policy; fuel import rules; etc.).

Microfinance banks (MFBs)	Medium	Varies; often improving but capacity uneven	Medium; some have agile operations	Medium–high depending on ownership and geography	Reaching micro- and small clients; local payrolls; humanitarians in specific corridors	Strengthened supervision; consumer protection rules; better data and credit reporting
Large exchangers / hawala networks	High systemic importance; unmanaged systemic risk	Medium–high (depending on controls)	Relatively low – highly adaptive and resilient	High: often closely tied to power centers	Almost all everyday payments; remittances; humanitarian cash	Licensing, reporting requirements, corridor-based supervision; negotiated norms with authorities
Small/local exchangers	Limited systemic, but important locally	Highly variable; often informal	Medium; can close suddenly	Localized capture	Last-mile distribution; remote or insecure areas	Tiered regulation; partnerships with larger, supervised institutions
Mobile / e-money providers	Emerging systemic role; design-dependent	Medium; can be well-controlled if KYC integrated	Medium; depends on telecom resilience and power supply	Depends on ownership; can be significant	Scalable small payments; remote top-ups; micro-merchant networks	Interoperability standards; clear e-money rules; data protection
Direct cash (envelopes)	No systemic stability role	Low AML visibility but high misuse risk if large volumes	High logistical risk; theft, diversion, security	High, especially if routed via local power brokers	Extreme contexts with no viable FSP; acute emergencies	Limit duration; strong monitoring; rapid transition plan to safer channels

D. VISUALS – DESIGN BRIEFS + CAPTIONS

You’ll hand these to a designer (or future you). I’ll keep them precise.

Figure 1 – Stacked Timeline, 2015–2025

Where to insert

Right after Table 1 in Section 1.

Design brief
	•	One horizontal timeline from 2015 to 2025.
	•	Four stacked “bands” (layers) running across:
	1.	Conflict / political events (war onset, major agreements, escalations).
	2.	CBY / monetary events (relocation, key circulars, note issuance).
	3.	Exchange-rate shocks (big devaluations, brief stabilizations).
	4.	Aid & remittance milestones (humanitarian scale-up, major cash shifts, big remittance shocks).

Caption to use:

⸻

Figure 2 – “Follow the Money” Sankey Diagram

Where to insert

In the section on humanitarian cash and informal finance, following Table 2.

Design brief
	•	Three snapshots in one figure or three small panels: 2014, 2018, 2024.
	•	On each:
	•	Left: Sources (Donors, Government budget, Remittances).
	•	Middle: Channels (Banks, MFBs, Exchangers/Hawala, Direct Cash).
	•	Right: End-points (Households, Traders/Firms, Public servants, Service providers).
	•	Thickness of flows: qualitative, not numerically precise, but clearly showing:
	•	2014: thick flows via banks; thinner via exchangers.
	•	2018: flows splitting, exchangers much thicker.
	•	2024: exchangers + MFBs dominating, banks thinner.

Figure 3 – Three Indices Over Time (HDI, BDS, LSM)

Where to insert

At the end of your section “The Rise of Informal Finance and Microfinance Banks”, just before you move to digital/climate/SDG layers.

Design brief
	•	X-axis: Years 2014–2025.
	•	Y-axis: index scale 0–100 (relative, not absolute).
	•	Three lines:
	1.	Hawala Dependence Index (HDI-Yemen) – increasing steadily.
	2.	Bank Disintermediation Score (BDS) – rising as banks lose share of actual flows.
	3.	Licensing Shock Meter (LSM) – flat, then spikes in years of heavy licensing or major regulatory change.
	•	You don’t need real numbers; use normalized indices (e.g. set 2014 = 10 for all three, adjust trend qualitatively).

Caption:

Design brief
	•	Map of Yemen with: Aden, Sana’a, Taiz, Hodeidah, Marib, Mukalla, Sayoun, key borders (Saudi, Oman).
	•	Draw arrows showing major money and goods corridors: import routes, remittance flows, humanitarian hubs.
	•	Use different line styles or thickness for: trade-linked flows, remittance flows, aid flows.

Design brief

Two side-by-side network diagrams.
	•	Panel A (2014):
	•	Banks drawn as large central nodes.
	•	Exchangers as smaller, peripheral nodes.
	•	Many links between banks and fewer between exchangers.
	•	Panel B (2024):
	•	Exchangers + a few large MFBs as the biggest nodes in the center.
	•	Banks smaller, with fewer connections.
	•	Dense web among exchangers/MFBs, showing them as real settlement network.

Figure 6 – 2030 Scenario Matrix

Where to insert

At the end of your section “Where Policy and Assistance Need to Shift”, as a forward-looking close before your final paragraphs.

Design brief
	•	2×2 matrix.
	•	Horizontal axis: Political settlement
	•	Left: Continued fragmentation
	•	Right: Fragile but functioning national settlement
	•	Vertical axis: Regulatory and financial architecture
	•	Bottom: Dual/competing, incoherent regimes
	•	Top: Coherent, inclusive financial governance

You get four quadrants; give each a short name + 2 lines:
	1.	Top Right – “Rewired Recovery”
	•	Settlement + coherent financial framework.
	•	Hawala/MFB ecosystem integrated, supervised, and used to rebuild monetary transmission.
	2.	Top Left – “Martial Markets”
	•	Fragmented politics + tough local controls.
	•	Local authorities clamp down on flows; high risk of arbitrary interventions and parallel currencies.
	3.	Bottom Right – “Entrenched Informalism”
	•	Settlement but little progress on financial governance.
	•	Shadow system remains dominant; banks remain weak; CBY technically unified but practically marginal.
	4.	Bottom Left – “Permanent Workaround”
	•	Fragmented politics + incoherent rules.
	•	Full lock-in of today’s pattern: dual CBYs, hawala as infrastructure, aid and remittances sustaining a low-equilibrium economy.

Table 1 – Yemen’s Financial Stress Dashboard, 2015–2025

Paste this under:

Table 1. Yemen’s Financial Stress Dashboard, 2015–2025 (Qualitative Overview)

| Year | Major conflict / political shock | CBY configuration | Exchange-rate situation | Liquidity in banks (cash availability) | Dominant channels for household payments | Aid & remittance importance |
|------|----------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| 2015 | War escalates; regional intervention; state institutions severely disrupted | Unified CBY, but under extreme fiscal and political stress | Sharp depreciation and volatility; widening gap between official and market rates emerges | Rapid deterioration; branches struggle to meet withdrawals, especially in FX | Mix of banks, cash, and local exchangers; early shift to hawala where banks are inaccessible | Remittances already vital; humanitarian funding ramps up but still relatively modest in volume |
| 2016 | Conflict entrenches; salary arrears spread; public trust in state weakens | CBY relocation decision triggers operational and political split | FX shortages deepen; unofficial market rates increasingly drive real prices | Severe shortages of Yemeni rial and USD; generalized withdrawal limits | Households rely more on exchangers and cash-on-hand; banks begin to lose centrality in daily life | Remittances become primary lifeline for many; aid grows but not yet dominant in overall inflows |
| 2017 | Frontlines partially stabilize; humanitarian crisis intensifies (cholera, food insecurity) | De facto dual CBY authorities emerge; fragmented decision-making | Multiple exchange rates consolidate; import costs rise sharply | Banks hold illiquid public debt; large shares of deposits effectively frozen or restricted | Hawala and exchangers become key for salaries in some areas; banks still used where physically and politically accessible | Humanitarian cash / vouchers expand quickly; remittances remain core survival income |
| 2018 | Fragmented governance and competing economic centers (north/south) | Rival CBYs issue conflicting circulars and enforcement threats | Dual exchange-rate regimes harden; geographic spreads widen | Chronic structural illiquidity; some branches semi-frozen or reliant on rationed cash | Exchangers and humanitarian FSPs dominate household transfers; cash becomes more localized | Remittances plus aid constitute the main external inflows for many communities |
| 2019 | Protracted conflict with limited political progress; local power centers consolidate | Parallel CBY operations normalize; separate banknote policies take shape | Continued depreciation in some areas; complex patchwork of rates and arbitrage | Banks increasingly sidelined from retail payments; focus on survival functions and trade paperwork | Hawala now primary everyday payment channel in many cities and corridors | Aid at or near peak; remittances critical but sensitive to Gulf/global conditions |
| 2020 | COVID-19 overlays on conflict; mobility and trade disrupted | Fragmented CBY operations face pandemic operational constraints | FX volatility layered on trade disruptions; import bills fluctuate | Branch access, IT and staffing all stressed; operational continuity uneven | Heavier reliance on exchangers, NGO delivery agents, and hand-to-hand cash in lockdown periods | Humanitarian flows adapt modalities; remittances dip then partially recover with global reopening |
| 2021 | Local realignments; economic warfare intensifies (revenues, ports, customs) | No unified monetary policy; rival CBYs use regulations as leverage | Exchange-rate swings used politically; local rules differ by authority | Liquidity management ad hoc and politicized, especially across frontlines | For most households, relationships with exchangers more important than any bank relationship | Aid programs consolidate FSP models; remittances remain macro-stabilizer despite volatility |
| 2022 | Oil revenue disputes and new economic measures sharpen divides | Rival CBYs instrumentalized in broader economic confrontation | Exchange-rate fragmentation deepens; speculative behavior and local spreads persist | Formal banking channel marginal to most ordinary transactions; some banks retrench further | MFBs and large exchangers capture growing share of payroll, aid, and remittances | Remittances crucial; aid under pressure but still systemic in many governorates |
| 2023 | Political track stalls; international attention shifts to other crises | Technical engagement with IFIs grows but institutional reunification remains incomplete | Periods of partial rate stabilization amid underlying fragility | Banks function in narrow niches (trade docs, specific payrolls, reporting) with limited public trust | Hybrid ecosystem consolidates: banks for narrow functions, exchangers/MFBs for daily life | Aid begins to plateau or decline in some sectors; remittances remain core safety net |
| 2024 | Continued low-intensity conflict and economic fragmentation; incremental talks without full settlement | Dual CBY reality persists; some technical coordination efforts but no single effective monetary anchor | Occasional policy moves to manage rates, but structural divergence between regions continues | No structural recovery in liquidity; many people treat bank deposits as risky or semi-frozen | Non-bank rails (exchangers, MFBs, wallets) entrenched as default; banks used mainly when required | Gradual shift from large-scale emergency aid towards more targeted support; climate and development finance remain limited; remittances still central |
| 2025 | Uncertain transition period; mix of negotiation fatigue and local accommodations | Prospects of reunification of CBY debated but unresolved; technical fixes outpace political ones | Exchange-rate risk remains a key household concern; trust anchored in local networks, not official rates | Liquidity patterns depend more on local power structures and FSP networks than on CBY tools | Informal and semi-formal architecture treated as “normal” by households, traders, and many agencies | Remittances and whatever concessional flows are mobilized (including climate/development windows) shape the room for any future stabilization effort |

You can tweak 2024–2025 phrasing based on your latest intel, but at least nothing is left blank.

Table 2 – Main Channels Used for Key Money Flows

Paste this under:

Table 2. Main Channels Used for Key Money Flows, Before and During the Conflict (Qualitative)

| Flow type | 2014 (baseline, pre-war) | 2018 | 2022 | 2025 (current pattern, approximate) |
|-----------|--------------------------|------|------|-------------------------------------|
| Government salaries | Mostly via commercial banks, with cash payout at branches; some direct cash in remote areas | Mixed: banks in some urban/government areas; exchangers and direct cash in contested or cut-off zones | Largely via exchangers, local authorities’ designated agents, or ad hoc mechanisms; banks handle limited segments (e.g. some security, SOEs, or project staff) | Continued heavy use of non-bank intermediaries; patchy bank-based payrolls only in specific sectors/geographies where political and logistical conditions allow |
| Humanitarian cash transfers | Limited; most assistance in-kind, with some voucher schemes and bank-linked pilots | Large scale-up of cash and vouchers; agencies experiment with both banks and FSPs (exchangers) for delivery | FSP models mature; many agencies deliberately choose exchangers/MFBs over banks for reach, speed, and lower friction | Humanitarian design increasingly assumes a **non-bank default** (FSPs, MFBs, wallets), with banks used mainly where donor rules or audit needs require them |
| Remittances (international) | Mix of banks, money transfer operators, and established hawala; cash payout primarily in major cities | Shift toward hawala/exchangers as trust in banks erodes and access becomes patchy | Hawala/exchangers dominate especially for smaller and medium transfers; banks retain a niche for large, documented, or corporate transfers | Hawala entrenched as the primary remittance channel nationwide, with banks used selectively for specific corridors, regulated senders, or larger-ticket flows |
| Trade finance (imports) | Bank-centric LCs and correspondent banking (mainly via Gulf hubs); clear paper trail | Banks still central for formal documentation and LCs; traders increasingly layer in exchangers to source FX and manage timing | Dual structures: banks for paperwork/compliance; exchangers/hawala for practical FX sourcing, settlement, and cross-frontline settlement | Importers operate through complex hybrids; large exchangers, MFBs, and a few banks are all involved, but **price discovery and liquidity are driven outside formal banking** |
| Local business payments (B2B) | Cheques, bank transfers, and cash; banks still important for larger transactions | Cash and exchanger-mediated transfers increasingly common; cheques less trusted | Predominantly cash, hawala, and internal transfer books of large exchangers/MFBs; limited use of formal bank transfers | Non-bank networks function as de facto clearinghouses for local B2B flows; banks’ role is episodic, often triggered by specific contracts, donors, or regulations |

Table 3 – Simplified View of Yemen’s Financial Landscape

Paste this under:

Table 3. Simplified View of Yemen’s Formal and Semi-Formal Financial Landscape

| Category | Pre-2015 situation | By around 2020 | By mid-2020s (trend) |
|----------|--------------------|----------------|----------------------|
| Commercial banks | Core of formal system; key for deposits, trade finance, and public sector accounts; seen as relatively safe despite low inclusion | Still important for external trade documentation and some payroll; weakened by illiquidity, arrears, and regulatory conflict; public trust shaken | Niche but necessary for specific functions (LCs, some payroll, donor compliance); no longer the main interface for households or small firms; balance sheets burdened by contested public claims |
| Islamic banks | Growing segment with specific client base; part of formal banking architecture | Exposed to same macro/political shocks as others; some retain slightly stronger retail ties in conservative markets | Survive in focused niches; face similar constraints as other banks: FX risk, legal uncertainty, politicized regulation |
| Microfinance banks (MFBs) | Small number; early stage; limited outreach mostly in urban centers | Noticeable expansion; several exchangers transform into MFBs; regulators encourage growth as a way to reach underbanked | Rapid proliferation; quality and risk management vary widely; clear potential for inclusion but risk of mission drift, over-indebtedness, and regulatory arbitrage |
| Microfinance institutions (MFIs, non-bank) | Donor-linked under Social Fund; designed to support micro/small enterprises, especially in poorer areas | Strained by conflict logistics, funding volatility, and competition from newly licensed MFBs | Still relevant in some segments but overshadowed in visibility and scale by MFBs and larger exchangers; sustainability depends on continued concessional support and smart partnerships |
| Money exchangers / hawala networks | Important intermediaries but peripheral to the “official” financial narrative; focused on FX and remittances | Become crucial to keeping the economy moving; handle salaries, remittances, trade payments, and humanitarian flows in many areas | Function as **backbone of the payment system** for most households and many businesses; central nodes in a de facto parallel settlement system that operates across political lines |
| Digital / e-money providers | Almost negligible; pilot projects and limited mobile money presence | Pilots and early products expand; limited interoperability; regulatory clarity still lacking | Expanding but fragmented; design shaped heavily by telecom ownership, local power structures, and rival CBY rules; big potential if governance, interoperability, and consumer protection are strengthened |

Table 4 – Policy & Governance Turning Points

Paste this where you wrote:

Table 4. Illustrative Policy and Governance Turning Points and Their Financial Consequences

| Approx. date | Actor(s) | Decision / event | Immediate financial effect | Medium-term consequence |
|--------------|----------|------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------|
| 2016 | Political authorities; CBY leadership | Decision to relocate CBY headquarters from Sana’a to Aden | Operational disruption; uncertainty over salary payments; staff and archives split; questions over which authority controls reserves | De facto emergence of dual monetary authorities; competing claims over reserves, public debt, and regulatory power; confidence in CBY neutrality eroded |
| 2017–2018 | Rival CBYs | Issuance of conflicting circulars (reserve requirements, FX rules, bank relocations, branch reporting) | Banks forced to navigate contradictory instructions; heightened legal and compliance risk | Banks retrench; some operations relocate; more flows move through exchangers to avoid being trapped between competing regulators |
| 2018–2019 | De facto authorities and local governments | Introduction of new levies, fees, and “service charges” on trade, fuel, and transport across frontlines | Increased cost and complexity of moving goods and cash; rise of unofficial charges | Growth of specialized corridors and intermediaries with political protection; further blurring of lines between fiscal and coercive power |
| 2017–2020 | Donors, UN agencies, major INGOs | Large-scale shift towards cash and voucher assistance, including multi-purpose cash | Need for fast, last-mile financial channels beyond formal banks; tenders opened to exchangers and MFBs | Aid becomes a stable revenue stream for selected FSPs and exchangers; reinforces their centrality and bargaining power inside the financial ecosystem |
| 2020–2023 | Rival CBYs; financial regulators | Waves of new licenses for MFBs and payment service providers; differential rules across jurisdictions | Rapid increase in number of lightly supervised entities; heightened competition in urban markets | Elevated risk of mission drift, over-lending, and weak consumer protection; opportunity to expand financial inclusion if supervision, data, and credit information catch up |
| 2021–2024 | International community, IFIs, climate funds | Initial engagement on climate/development finance with limited direct access for Yemeni institutions | Technical dialogue begins but with very high access barriers for national actors | Climate and development finance mostly routed through external intermediaries; risk that new flows bypass domestic financial sector rather than strengthening it |

You can add rows for any other key moves you care about (sanctions, fuel import rules, major CBY circulars, etc.).

Table 5 – Comparative Risk and Use-Case Profile of Main Payment Channels

Paste this where you wrote:

Table 5. Comparative Risk and Use-Case Profile of Main Payment Channels

| Channel | Systemic risk (for overall stability) | AML/CFT risk | Operational continuity risk | Political capture risk | When it is strategically useful | Key mitigations needed |
|---------|----------------------------------------|--------------|----------------------------|------------------------|---------------------------------|------------------------|
| Commercial banks | Medium–high, given fragility of balance sheets and exposure to contested public debt | Lower on paper (formal KYC, reporting, audit), but effectiveness depends on capacity and independence | High in some areas: branches can be cut off, threatened, or unable to source cash/FX | Medium: subject to pressure from authorities, large shareholders, and security actors | Large, documented payments; trade finance (LCs, guarantees); payroll for specific segments; where donor/government rules require bank use | Partial guarantees and risk-sharing; coordinated regulation between rival CBYs; realistic liquidity support; protection measures for staff and premises |
| Microfinance banks (MFBs) | Medium: growing footprint but not yet “too big to fail” nationally; clustered risks in certain corridors | Variable: some implement strong controls, others are still building systems | Medium: lighter footprint allows flexibility but also vulnerability to local shocks | Medium–high depending on ownership, local alignments, and licensing politics | Reaching micro- and small clients; local payrolls; humanitarian cash in specific corridors; savings products for lower-income segments | Strengthen supervision and reporting; enforce consumer protection; support internal controls and IT; integrate into credit information systems where possible |
| Large exchangers / hawala networks | High: they are de facto backbone of payments; failure or sanctioning of a large network can destabilize flows | Medium–high: risk depends on internal controls, correspondent relationships, and oversight; often less formalized | Relatively low in practice: highly adaptive, can shift routes and modalities quickly | High: often closely tied to power centers, local authorities, or security actors | Everyday domestic payments; remittances; cross-frontline trade; humanitarian cash distribution | Tiered licensing and corridor-based supervision; pragmatic reporting regimes; engagement rather than purely punitive measures; negotiated norms with authorities |
| Small / local exchangers | Low systemic but important for local resilience | Highly variable; often informal with minimal AML structures | Medium: can close suddenly or be disrupted by local conflict, but also re-emerge | Localized capture by community leaders or armed groups | Last-mile cash-out and cash-in; remote or insecure areas where larger actors do not operate | Link to larger supervised partners; simplified registration and basic KYC; community-based oversight; gradually bring into formal perimeter without over-burdening |
| Mobile / e-money providers | Emerging systemic role depending on scale; poorly governed systems could create new vulnerabilities | Medium: can be well-controlled if KYC and transaction monitoring are embedded in design | Medium: depend on telecom resilience, power supply, and digital infrastructure | Depends on ownership structure and regulatory oversight; can be significant if monopolized | Scalable small payments; remote top-ups; merchant networks; potential backbone for social protection and salary schemes | Clear e-money regulations; interoperability standards; robust data and cyber-security; enforceable consumer protection and recourse |
| Direct cash (envelopes) | No positive systemic role; large volumes handled this way can undermine attempts at traceability | High opacity; very limited visibility for AML/CFT, though sometimes used in extreme contexts | High: theft, diversion, security incidents; logistically costly | High: easily captured or taxed by local power brokers and armed actors | Acute emergencies; areas with no viable FSPs; very short-term stopgaps while safer channels are built | Strict time limits; strong monitoring and community feedback; clear transition plans to more formal channels as soon as feasible |

حاضر يا ماهر.
هذه هي النسخة العربية المُحكَمة والشاملة—موسَّعة ثلاثة أضعاف، بصياغة احترافية دقيقة، وجاهزة للتنفيذ. أرفقت لك أيضًا ملف Excel متعدد الأوراق يضمّ “قائمة تدقيق تشغيلية للمشرف” + سجلّ المصادر + نموذج البيانات + نقاط المراجعة الأسبوعية.

تحميل الملف:
تنزيل ملف Excel – YEC_Master_Checklist_AR.xlsx

⸻

1) بيان الغرض والهوية (مختصر مبدئي)

منصّة “البوصلة الاقتصادية لليمن” هي منتج عام مستقلّ وشفّاف يقدّم:
	•	قراءة سريعة (“حكم 10 ثوانٍ”) لاقتصاد الحرب.
	•	تفكيكًا منهجيًا لأسباب التغيّرات (تفكيك الصدمات).
	•	تتبّعًا لتدفّق الأموال (اتبع المال) عبر القنوات الرسمية وغير الرسمية.
	•	محرّك تقارير يُحوِّل التفاعل إلى مذكّرات من صفحة واحدة.
	•	سجلّ مصادر موثّق، ونموذج بيانات يمكن إعادة استخدامه لدول نزاع أخرى.

المعيار الأخلاقي: الاستقلالية، الشفافية، عدم الإضرار—مع وسم مستوى الثقة لكل سلسلة، والتجميع الجغرافي/الزمني للأرقام الحسّاسة.

ملاحظة منهجية: إحدى لوحاتك التجريبية تُظهر هبوط الدخل الحقيقي للفرد إلى ~45% من خط أساس 2015 بحلول 2025؛ يجب أن ينعكس ذلك في بطاقة “الدخل الحقيقي للفرد” داخل “البوصلة” وفي سطر الشرح المصاحب لها.

⸻

2) إضافات عالية الأثر (مطلوبة قبل إطلاق النسخة العامة)
	1.	بطاقة منهج (Method Card) ثابتة لأي رقم/رسم: المصدر، التواتر، آخر تحديث، القيود، مستوى الثقة، نوع القيمة (رسمي/تقدير مثلّث/تقدير خبير)—تظهر في التولتيب وتلازم الفلاتر.
	2.	وضع الاتصال الضعيف: نسخة خفيفة تُظهر بطاقات أرقام وجداول CSV فقط + زر “تحميل الرسوم لاحقًا”.
	3.	معرّفات كونية موحّدة (Global IDs): لكل مؤشر/سلسلة/حدث/قرار/فاعل/منطقة (ADM0–ADM2).
	4.	لوحة “التغيّر منذ 2014”: فارق تراكمي في الناتج/التضخم/سعر الصرف (عدن/صنعاء + الفجوة)/النفط/المساعدات/صحة المصارف—في سطر واحد.
	5.	تفكيك الصدمات (Shock Decomposition): أعمدة مكدّسة تُظهر مساهمة: مرور سعر الصرف، الشحن/التأمين، صدمات الغذاء/الوقود، السياسة النقدية، الضرائب/الرسوم.
	6.	مصفوفة “من يتأثر بماذا؟” تربط الأدوات (مزادات، إصدارات نقدية، قيود سحب، رسوم) بالفاعلين (أُسر/تجّار/مصارف/صرافين/منظمات) مع اتجاه الأثر + شدته.
	7.	محرّك تقارير صفحة واحدة من أيّ مزيج فلاتر (سنة/جغرافيا/موضوع/سيناريو).
	8.	معيار عدم الإضرار: تجميع وإخفاء ذكي، وتأخير نشر سلاسل محدّدة عند اللزوم.
	9.	مؤشرات مركّبة جديدة:
	•	HDI‑Y (Hawala Dependence Index – Yemen)
	•	BDS (Bank Disintermediation Score)
	•	SII (Sanctions Intensity Index) وSFI (Sanctions Fragmentation Index)
	•	CBSI (Core Banking Stress Index)
	10.	خريطة السيطرة الاقتصادية: نفوذ/موانئ/نفط/معابر/جباية + طبقة “اتبع المال” (Sankey).

⸻

5) اللوحات المميّزة (للإطلاق)

أ) البوصلة (Master Compass)
	•	12 بطاقة أساسية تُحدَّث بمنزلق الزمن—بينها: الناتج الحقيقي (مقارنة 2014)، الدخل الحقيقي للفرد، CPI عدن/صنعاء، سعر الصرف وعدن/صنعاء والفجوة، سلة الغذاء، النفط، المساعدات (FTS)، SII، CBSI.
	•	مبدّل عدن/صنعاء/كلاهما + زر “ماذا يعني هذا؟” يشرح الأثر على الرواتب/الأسعار/التجارة بلغة مبسطة.
	•	تصدير CSV/PNG مع بطاقة المنهج لكل عنصر.
	•	نسخة اتصال ضعيف: بطاقات أرقام + جداول قصيرة.

نص واجهة مقترح:

البوصلة: حرِّك الشريط الزمني لترى قصة الاقتصاد تتبدّل—بالمصدر، وبوضوح، وبدون ضجيج.

ب) تفكيك الصدمات (Shock Decomposition)
	•	يشرح ممّا يتكوّن التضخم/الانكماش عبر أعمدة مكدّسة لكل ربع/سنة.
	•	تفعيل/تعطيل مساهمات (FX pass‑through، الشحن/التأمين، غذاء/وقود داخلي، سياسة نقدية، ضرائب).
	•	نافذة أحداث ±90 يومًا لقياس أثر قرارات البنكين/الصدمات البحرية.

صياغة منهج قصيرة على اللوحة:

النتائج إرشادية مبنية على مرونات موثّقة محليًا؛ ليست تنبؤًا رسميًا.

ج) اتبع المال (Follow the Money)
	•	Sankey ديناميكي: (المنابع: نفط/جمارك/ضرائب/منح) → (قنوات: مصارف/صرافين/موبايل) → (المصبات: رواتب/استيراد/معيشة/خدمات).
	•	“بطاقة قناة” تبيّن التعريف، القيود، الامتثال، المخاطر، وأثرها على فجوة الصرف.
	•	سياسة نزاهة: تجميع جغرافي وتأخير نشر للأرقام التي قد تعرّض أفرادًا للخطر.

نص واجهة:

من المنبع إلى المستفيد. اكتشف أين تتكدّس التدفقات، وأين تتسرب، وأين يُفتح عنق الزجاجة.

د) محرّك التقارير (One‑Page Report Engine)
	•	يُنتج PDF/HTML من صفحة واحدة لجمهور (مانح/وزير/إعلام/قطاع خاص) مع:

جداول ربط: event_impact | decision_impact | indicator_dependency | actor_asset | series_source.
الرخصة الافتراضية: Open Data (CC BY 4.0) مع استثناءات للبيانات الحسّاسة.

كل سلسلة تحمل مستوى ثقة (مرتفع/متوسط/منخفض) وتاريخ آخر تحديث + الشخص المسؤول.

⸻

7) الحوكمة والجودة
	•	10 قواعد ذهبية: لا رسم بلا (عنوان/وحدة/مدى/مصدر)؛ لا رقم بلا بطاقة منهج؛ إبراز الثقة؛ سجلّ تغييرات نسخة/نسخة؛ اختبارات قبول لكل وحدة؛ مراجعة أمنية “عدم الإضرار”.
	•	مراجعة قبل النشر: تحقق سردي/بياني/أمني + تدقيق مرجع.
	•	لغة محايدة صارمة: تسمية الوقائع بهدوء، بلا شعارات.

⸻

8) التنفيذ التقني (مختصر واقعي)
	•	خيار (أ): WordPress (CPTs + ACF + WPGraphQL) + ECharts/Chart.js.
	•	خيار (ب): Headless (WordPress + Next.js/Node 20 + TypeScript + ECharts + Postgres/ClickHouse).

⸻

9) تحسين النصوص العربية للواجهات (Repository & Observatories)

البحث في المستودع:
	•	حقل البحث: “ابحث بالعنوان أو الجهة أو الكلمات المفتاحية…”
	•	الفلاتر:
	•	السنة (جميع السنوات | 2025 | 2024 | …)
	•	الجهة الناشرة (جميع الجهات – منظمات دولية/مراكز أبحاث/حكومية…)
	•	النوع (تقرير | دراسة | ورقة بحثية | موجز)
	•	زرّان لكل بطاقة: عرض المستخلص | اذهب إلى الأصل.
	•	شارة صغيرة في البطاقة: “منشور في/آخر تحديث”، “اللغة”، “حقوق الاستخدام”.

مرصد التمويل الأصغر:
	•	مقدّمة قصيرة: “تتبّع شامل لمؤسسات التمويل الأصغر والبنوك المتخصصة—الفروع، العملاء، محفظة القروض، الادخار—مع تحذيرات شفافية ومستويات ثقة.”
	•	تبويب “نظرة عامة” (محفظة إجمالية، العملاء، المقترضون، المدخرون).
	•	تبويب “البرامج والمؤسسات” ببطاقات موحّدة (الاسم، التغطية، العملاء، المحفظة، نسبة النساء إن توفّرت، الملاحظات).
	•	تحذير سفلي: “البيانات من التقرير السنوي لمحفظة القروض—التحديث: يونيو 2025—مستوى الثقة: متوسط.”

⸻

10) محرّك السيناريو (قواعد دنيا واضحة)

مدخلات (Sliders): سعر النفط | صادرات النفط | المنح/الودائع | المساعدات النقدية | شدة العقوبات | سياسة FX | قيود السحب المصرفي | تكاليف الشحن/التأمين | صدمة أمنية مؤقتة.
مخرجات: فجوة FX عدن/صنعاء | التضخم العام/الغذاء | الناتج الحقيقي | مسار الفقر (استرشادي) | CBSI | كلفة سلة الغذاء | أثر على التجارة.
منطق مبسّط (أمثلة):
	•	↑النفط ⇒ ↑عرض العملات ⇒ ↓فجوة FX ⇒ ↓التضخم المستورد.
	•	↑العقوبات ⇒ ↑تكاليف التجارة/التأمين ⇒ ↑الأسعار ↓وصول المصارف.
	•	↑المساعدات النقدية ⇒ ↑طلب قصير على FX مع أثر توازني على الأسعار.

كل مرونة موثّقة في صفحة /methods وموسومة “استرشادي لا تنبؤ”.

⸻

11) أصحاب المصلحة والقطاع المالي
	•	بطاقات للبنوك التجارية (ترخيص، فروع، ملاءة، ملاحظات) + كيانات التمويل الأصغر (الأمل/الكريمي… إلخ).
	•	ركن “شبكات الحوالة/الصرافة”: يُملأ حصريًا من قوائم الترخيص الرسمية واتحادات الصرافين—مع حقول: الاسم القانوني، نطاق التغطية، طبيعة القنوات، ملاحظات الامتثال.
	•	تنبيه واضح: عدم نشر أسماء أفراد أو تفاصيل تشغيلية حسّاسة؛ التركيز على الكيانات المرخّصة والبيانات العامة فقط.

⸻

12) ركن القوانين واللوائح (مقترح مسارات ومحتوى)
	•	الدستور اليمني (النص النافذ).
	•	قانون البنك المركزي (غالبًا قانون رقم 14 لسنة 2000 – راجع النص الرسمي/المعتمد).
	•	قانون البنوك وقانون مكافحة غسل الأموال وتمويل الإرهاب ولائحته.
	•	قوانين الضرائب والجمارك (عدن/صنعاء)، قانون الزكاة في الشمال، لوائح التجارة والاستيراد ونشرات الرقابة على النقد.
	•	صفحة “كيف نستخدم القانون”: ملخصات عملية + روابط للنصوص الأصلية + حالة التنفيذ.

مصدر تمهيدي للتعريف بقانون البنك المركزي (إشارة إلى رقم القانون والتعريف): اتحاد المصارف اليمنية ينشر مختصرًا لقانون رقم 14 لسنة 2000.

⸻

13) إستراتيجية المصادر والروابط الرسمية (مع صفحات التقارير/البيانات)

المبدأ: الروابط أدناه تُستخدم في /methods وسجلّ المصادر وفي وحدة /reports، وتُجهَّز لها موصّلات (Adapters) للـAPI/RSS حيث يتاح.

⸻

1) الرؤية والولاية التحريرية

المشكلة: اقتصاد ممزّق، مؤسسات منقسمة، بيانات متفرقة، روايات متعارضة.
الحل: البوصلة الاقتصادية لليمن—منصّة عامة، ثنائية اللغة، تربط الأرقام بالأحداث، وتسمح بفهم ما حدث، واختبار ما كان يمكن أن يحدث، واستكشاف ما قد يحدث.

ميثاق النزاهة (ملزِم):
	•	الدقّة والشفافية: كل رقم له مصدر ظاهر، تاريخ آخر تحديث، ومستوى ثقة (مرتفع/متوسط/منخفض).
	•	الاستقلال: لا بروباغندا؛ التمويل/الشراكات لا تملي النتائج.
	•	بساطة اللغة: مصطلحات معرّفة، فقرات قصيرة، صناديق «خلاصة».
	•	السلامة (Do‑No‑Harm): إخفاء/تجميع الأرقام الحسّاسة، تمويه جغرافي/زمني عند الحاجة.
	•	المواءمة مع المعايير: SDGs (1، 8، 16، 17)، ومبادئ IMF‑DQAF، وشفافية المساعدات (IATI/FTS).

المشهد المالي اليمني خلال النزاع (2015–2025)

شهدت البنية التحتية المالية في اليمن بين عامي 2015 و2025 تحولًا عميقًا حدث بمعظمه بعيدًا عن أنظار المجتمع الدولي. عندما انقسم البنك المركزي وتعطلت القنوات المصرفية الرسمية، واجه العاملون في المجال الإنساني تحديًا غير مسبوق: كيف يمكن تحريك الأموال على نطاق واسع في مشهد مالي مجزأ بسبب الحرب؟ كان الحل البراغماتي هو توجيه التحويلات النقدية الطارئة عبر شبكات الصرافة (الحوالات) ومؤسسات التمويل الأصغر. نجحت هذه المقاربة في إيصال المساعدات المنقذة للحياة للملايين، لكنها في الوقت ذاته أشعلت شرارة إعادة هيكلة جذرية للنظام المالي اليمني.

اليوم تهيمن الجهات غير المصرفية على توفير السيولة وتنفيذ المدفوعات والتمويل اليومي. فلا تزال البنوك التقليدية مهمة للعمليات الدولية (مثل شبكة سويفت) والامتثال الرقابي، لكنها تراجعت إلى حد كبير عن مشهد الأنشطة المالية اليومية. لقد أدى تفكك النظام المصرفي إلى خلق مناطق عملة متوازية في البلاد بأسعار صرف متباينة جذريًا بين مناطق سيطرة الحكومة المعترف بها دوليًا ومناطق سيطرة سلطات صنعاء  .

أبرز المؤشرات (2015–2025):
	•	انخفاض الناتج المحلي الإجمالي للفرد: تراجع بنحو 58% مقارنة بمستواه عام 2015 .
	•	التضخم السنوي: وصل إلى 35% بحلول منتصف 2025 .
	•	انهيار العملة: سجل الريال اليمني أدنى قيمة تاريخية عند 2,905 ريال/دولار (يوليو 2025) .
	•	استنزاف الاحتياطيات الأجنبية: تقلصت الاحتياطيات النقدية بحوالي 88% منذ 2014 .
	•	الفقر وانعدام الأمن الغذائي: ارتفعت نسبة الفقر إلى 76%، وبلغ عدد من يعانون من انعدام غذائي حاد 17.1 مليون شخص  .
	•	عجز التمويل الإنساني: لم يتم تأمين سوى 19% فقط من احتياجات التمويل الإنساني لعام 2025 .

تسلسل زمني للأزمة المالية (2015–2025)
	•	2015 – تصاعد الصراع: اندلاع عملية “عاصفة الحزم” بقيادة السعودية في مارس. سيطرة الحوثيين على صنعاء وترحيل الحكومة. بداية الانهيار الاقتصادي .
	•	2016 – انقسام البنك المركزي: نقل مقر البنك المركزي اليمني من صنعاء إلى عدن في سبتمبر بقرار حكومي، ما نتج عنه وجود بنك مركزي موازٍ في صنعاء تحت سيطرة الحوثيين . بدأت بذلك حقبة ازدواج السلطة النقدية وتفكك النظام المصرفي.
	•	2017 – تباعد السياسات النقدية: بدأ بنك عدن بطباعة أوراق نقدية جديدة وضخ سيولة كبيرة، في حين حظرت سلطات صنعاء تداول تلك الإصدارات الجديدة في مناطقها . أدى ذلك إلى نشوء مسارين للعملة المحلية.
	•	2018 – حرب اقتصادية رغم الهدنة: رغم توقيع اتفاق ستوكهولم ووقف إطلاق النار في الحديدة (ديسمبر) ، استمرت الحرب الاقتصادية بين الطرفين، بما في ذلك الخلافات على إيرادات الدولة والسياسة النقدية.
	•	2019 – تفاقم أزمة العملة: تعثر تنفيذ اتفاق الرياض لتقاسم السلطة بين الحكومة والمجلس الانتقالي الجنوبي ، وتصاعدت أزمة انخفاض قيمة الريال خصوصًا في مناطق الحكومة.
	•	2020 – صدمة جائحة كورونا: فاقمت الجائحة العالمية الأزمة الاقتصادية، حيث تراجعت التحويلات من الخارج  وتقلصت موارد اليمنيين. كما تراجعت المساعدات الإنسانية مع اتساع الفجوة التمويلية.
	•	2021 – أزمة سعر الصرف: تسارع تدهور الريال في مناطق الحكومة الشرعية، وازداد ترسخ نظامي سعر الصرف المزدوج (سعر مخفّض في صنعاء ومستوى متدهور في عدن) . قفزت الأسعار في المناطق الحكومية نتيجة انهيار العملة المحلية.
	•	2022 – هدنة مؤقتة وتشكيل المجلس الرئاسي: بدأ وقف إطلاق نار برعاية أممية في أبريل، وتشكيل مجلس قيادة رئاسي جديد . شهد الاقتصاد بعض التحسن المؤقت مع تدفق دعم سعودي وإقليمي، لكن سرعان ما تلاشى الأثر مع استمرار الانقسام المالي.
	•	2023 – تصعيد في البحر الأحمر: هجمات حوثية على الملاحة في البحر الأحمر (ابتداءً من أكتوبر)  تسببت في اضطراب التجارة البحرية، مما عمّق عزلة الاقتصاد اليمني. استمر التباعد بين السياسات المالية شمالًا وجنوبًا.
	•	2024 – محاولات الاستقرار النقدي: سعت الحكومة في عدن لاتخاذ إجراءات لاستقرار سعر الصرف  (مثل تشديد تنظيم الصرافين وإجراء مزادات للعملة الأجنبية)، فحققت نجاحًا محدودًا. استمرت الأزمة الإنسانية مع بقاء الملايين بحاجة للمساعدة.
	•	2025 – تعمّق الانهيار: هبط الريال إلى مستويات قياسية (تجاوز 2900 ريال/دولار في عدن مقابل ~600 ريال/دولار في صنعاء)؛ اتسعت رقعة الفقر لتشمل ثلاثة أرباع السكان، ولم يتوفر من التمويل الإنساني الدولي سوى أقل من خمس الحاجة . يلوح خطر الانهيار الشامل للنظام المالي مع نفاد الخيارات.

ازدواجية السلطة النقدية وانقسام البنك المركزي

أدى انقسام البنك المركزي اليمني منذ 2016 إلى وجود سلطتين نقديتين متوازيتين: الأولى في عدن تحت إدارة الحكومة المعترف بها دوليًا (البنك المركزي اليمني – عدن)، والثانية في صنعاء تحت سيطرة سلطات الحوثيين (البنك المركزي – صنعاء). هذا الانشقاق المؤسسي العميق نتج عنه سياسات نقدية متباينة تمامًا وانقطاع أي تنسيق مالي على المستوى الوطني . يقوم كل طرف باتخاذ قرارات نقدية بمعزل عن الآخر، بما في ذلك إصدار العملة وإدارة المعروض النقدي.

في عدن، اعتمد البنك المركزي التابع للحكومة على الإصدار النقدي لتمويل العجز وتغطية النفقات، حيث تم طباعة كميات كبيرة من الريالات الجديدة منذ 2017. بالمقابل، رفضت سلطات صنعاء الاعتراف بهذه العملة الجديدة ومنعت تداولها في مناطقها، معتمدة على المخزون السابق من النقد (الإصدارات القديمة) وعلى إدارة أكثر تحفظًا للمعروض النقدي. وكنتيجة لذلك، ظهر ازدواج في العملة: الريال “الجنوبي” الصادر من عدن مقابل الريال “الشمالي” المتداول في صنعاء. ترتب على هذا الازدواج فجوة شاسعة في سعر الصرف بين السوقين؛ حيث تدهور سعر صرف الريال في المناطق الحكومية بشكل حاد بينما حافظت مناطق الحوثيين على سعر أقوى نسبيًا عبر إجراءات إدارية صارمة. وقد اعتبر كل جانب استخدام العملة التابعة للآخر “حربًا اقتصادية” وأداة ضغط .

بالإضافة إلى ذلك، افتقد اليمن سياسة نقدية موحدة أو احتياطيات مركزية مشتركة. فاحتياطيات النقد الأجنبي شحيحة أصلاً واستنزفت بشدة بعد 2015 . ومع انقسام السلطة، لم تعد هناك سلطة واحدة تستطيع إدارة السياسة النقدية على مستوى البلاد أو دعم العملة بشكل فعال. وأسهم غياب هذه المرجعية الموحدة في ترنح الثقة بالعملة الوطنية. كل طرف اتجه لاتخاذ إجراءات أحادية: بنك عدن أجرى عمليات ضخ سيولة وانتقل لاحقًا إلى نظام مزادات لبيع العملة الصعبة للمستوردين، بينما بنك صنعاء ركّز على ضبط السوق ومنع تسريب العملات الجديدة إلى مناطقه.

النتيجة المباشرة كانت سعران منفصلان للريال: أحدهما منهار في مناطق الحكومة الشرعية والآخر مستقر نسبيًا في مناطق الحوثيين. فعلى سبيل المثال، في عام 2025 تجاوز السعر في عدن 2900 ريال للدولار بينما بقي في صنعاء قريبًا من 600 ريال للدولار. هذا الواقع عطّل فعليًا أي تعاملات مالية بين المنطقتين وأضر بالنشاط التجاري والاستثماري على المستوى الوطني.

شلل وتفكك القطاع المصرفي

واجه القطاع المصرفي اليمني أزمة غير مسبوقة نتيجة الحرب وانقسام السلطات المالية. البنوك التجارية والإسلامية – وعددها يزيد عن 15 مصرفًا – وجدت نفسها عالقة بين تعليمات متعارضة من مركزين ماليين مختلفين. فمع نقل مقر البنك المركزي إلى عدن، اضطرت البنوك اسميًا لنقل مقراتها الرئيسية إلى هناك لتبقى تحت مظلة السلطة المعترف بها. لكن على أرض الواقع، استمرت معظم العمليات المصرفية وموظفي البنوك في صنعاء، حيث الكثافة السكانية والنشاط الاقتصادي الأوسع. هذا خلق حالة ازدواجية تنظيمية مربكة: إذ تتلقى البنوك أوامر من بنك عدن الخاضع للشرعية، وفي الوقت نفسه تواجه ضغوطًا وإملاءات من سلطات البنك المركزي في صنعاء .

التبعات كانت شللًا فعليًا في النظام المصرفي. تراجعت قدرة البنوك على أداء دورها الأساسي في الوساطة المالية. واجه المودعون صعوبات في سحب أموالهم مع شح السيولة وتجميد جزء كبير من الأصول (لا سيما أموال البنوك المودعة لدى البنك المركزي). تقلّصت عمليات الإقراض للقطاع الخاص إلى الحد الأدنى، وغابت الثقة مما دفع كثير من العملاء إلى العزوف عن التعامل مع البنوك كليًا.

أيضًا، تعطلت أنظمة المقاصة والتحويلات بين البنوك، خاصةً بين مصارف الشمال والجنوب، نتيجة انقطاع العلاقات بين البنكين المركزيين. على سبيل المثال، الشيكات الصادرة من مصارف صنعاء لم يعد يتم صرفها في عدن والعكس صحيح. كما تأثرت التعاملات الدولية للمصارف اليمنية؛ إذ تراجعت خطوط الائتمان مع البنوك المراسلة الأجنبية بسبب ارتفاع مخاطر الامتثال والعقوبات وتصنيف اليمن كمنطقة عالية المخاطر.

اضطرت بعض البنوك للتكيف عبر التركيز على أنشطة محدودة مثل خدمات الصرافة وتحويل الأموال، بينما اعتمدت أخرى على أذون الخزانة الحكومية (التي تعطلت هي الأخرى بسبب عجز الحكومة عن السداد). لقد أصبح القطاع المصرفي منقسمًا ومعزولًا: مصارف تخدم في نطاق سلطات الحكومة وأخرى ضمن نطاق سلطات الحوثيين، دون أي قناة رسمية تربط بينهما. وأدى ذلك إلى خروج المصارف من مشهد التمويل اليومي وتحول الأنظار نحو بدائل أخرى لإتمام المعاملات.

صعود الشبكات المالية الموازية (الحوالات والصرافة)

في ظل تراجع دور البنوك الرسمية، برزت بقوة شبكات الصرافة والتحويلات (الحوالات) لتملأ الفراغ المالي في اليمن. تاريخيًا، لعبت شركات الصرافة دورًا مهمًا في الاقتصاد اليمني لنقل الأموال داخليًا وخارجيًا، لكن خلال الحرب توسع هذا الدور ليصبح الركيزة الأساسية للنظام المالي. أصبح المواطنون والتجار والجهات الإغاثية يعتمدون بشكل شبه كلي على تلك الشبكات لإيداع الأموال وتحويلها وتوفير السيولة.

تضاعف عدد شركات ومحلات الصرافة بشكل كبير خلال سنوات النزاع. تشير بيانات رسمية إلى أن فروع شركات الصرافة قفزت من 876 فرعًا في 2017 إلى أكثر من 3,200 فرع في 2019   – انتشار هائل يعكس تنامي الاعتماد على هذه الخدمات. تمتاز شبكات الحوالة بقدرتها على الوصول إلى جميع المناطق وربط المحافظات بغض النظر عن خطوط النزاع، وهو ما عجزت عنه البنوك التقليدية التي تقلّص نشاطها. هكذا تمكن الصرّافون من تجاوز كثير من العوائق التي واجهتها المصارف، واستمروا في تقديم خدمات التحويل والصرف حتى في ذروة الاقتتال  .

من ناحية أخرى، توسعت مؤسسات التمويل الأصغر (البنوك المتخصصة بالتمويل المتناهي الصغر) لتقدم خدمات مالية لشريحة أوسع من السكان المحرومين من الخدمات البنكية. ورغم أن الشمول المالي كان ضعيفًا جدًا قبل الحرب – أقل من 10% من اليمنيين كان لديهم حساب مصرفي عام 2014  – إلا أن هذه المؤسسات حاولت سد الفجوة عبر تقديم قروض صغيرة وخدمات ادخار أساسية. ومع ذلك، تبقى قدرتها محدودة مقابل حجم الاقتصاد وحجم الحاجة في ظل الأزمة الإنسانية.

هيمنة القطاع غير المصرفي باتت واضحة: أصبحت شركات الصرافة هي الوجهة الرئيسية لودائع التجار ومصدر التمويل الأساسي للتجارة والاستيراد  . فهي توفر اعتمادات وتمويلًا للتجار حيثما توقفت البنوك. كما أنها أكثر مرونة في العمل عبر المناطق، فلدى كبار الصرافين فروع أو وكلاء في صنعاء وعدن ومختلف المدن، مما مكنهم من العمل كجسر مالي بين مختلف الأطراف بشكل غير رسمي.

هذا الواقع الإيجابي من حيث استمرارية الحركة المالية رافقته مخاطر أيضًا. فتنامي قطاع الحوالة خارج المظلة المصرفية التقليدية صعّب من الرقابة عليه. وأصبحت هناك مخاوف تتعلق بغسيل الأموال وتمويل الإرهاب نتيجة انخفاض مستوى الشفافية في هذه الشبكات  . كما أن اعتماد الاقتصاد على شبكات غير رسمية جعل صناع السياسات النقدية عاجزين عن قياس حجم السيولة بدقة أو التحكم بها.

رغم هذه التحديات، لا شك أن النظام المالي الموازي أدى دورًا حيويًا في إبقاء الاقتصاد اليمني على قيد الحياة. لقد تمكنت الأسر من استلام حوالات أقربائهم في المهجر، واستطاعت وكالات الإغاثة ضخ الأموال للمستفيدين، واستمر التجار في تمويل الاستيراد – وكل ذلك عبر آلية الحوالة التي أصبحت بمثابة العمود الفقري للتدفقات المالية في اليمن.

التحويلات المالية من الخارج (المغتربون)

تُمثّل تحويلات المغتربين اليمنيين شريان حياة للاقتصاد والمجتمع في اليمن. قبل الحرب وخلالها، اعتمدت مئات الآلاف من الأسر على الأموال المرسلة من أقاربهم العاملين في الخارج، لا سيما في دول الخليج العربي (السعودية خصوصًا) والولايات المتحدة وأوروبا. قدّرت هذه التحويلات بحوالي 3.8 مليار دولار في 2019 (نحو 13% من الناتج المحلي الإجمالي) ، ما يجعل اليمن من أعلى الدول اعتمادًا على التحويلات كنسبة إلى الاقتصاد.

خلال فترة النزاع، ازدادت أهمية التحويلات مع تراجع مصادر الدخل الأخرى وتدهور الاقتصاد المحلي. ورغم أن 2020 شهد انخفاضًا مؤقتًا في تدفقات التحويلات نتيجة جائحة كورونا وتبعاتها الاقتصادية ، سرعان ما استعادت التحويلات زخمها لتبقى رافدًا أساسيًا للعملة الصعبة. تُستخدم هذه الأموال المرسلة في تغطية النفقات المعيشية للأسر وشراء المواد الغذائية وتسديد الإيجارات، وبالتالي تلعب دورًا أساسيًا في التخفيف من حدة الكارثة الإنسانية.

تتم غالبية التحويلات عبر قنوات غير رسمية وشبكات الصرافة. فخلال الحرب، ومع الانقسام المصرفي، لجأت شركات التحويل العالمية (مثل ويسترن يونيون) إلى التعاون مع شبكات الصرافة المحلية لضمان وصول الأموال إلى مستحقيها في جميع مناطق اليمن. أيضًا لجأ الكثير من المغتربين إلى نظام الحوالة التقليدي نظرًا لسرعته وقدرته على الوصول حتى إلى القرى النائية. على سبيل المثال، قد يقوم عامل يمني في السعودية بتسليم المبلغ لأحد مكاتب الصرافة هناك، ويتولى المكتب عبر شبكته الداخلية توفير المبلغ لأسرة العامل في اليمن خلال ساعات.

تواجه التحويلات تحديات منها اختلاف سعر الصرف بين المناطق: فالأموال التي تصل إلى مستلم في صنعاء تُصرف بالريال بسعر صرف مختلف عمّا لو وصلت إلى عدن. هذا يعني أن بعض الأسر قد تستفيد فعليًا من سعر الصرف الأفضل في صنعاء إذا استلمت التحويلات هناك، فيما يخسر المرسلون جزءًا من القيمة إذا اُحتسبت تحويلاتهم بالسعر الرسمي أو المنخفض. وبرغم هذه التحديات، يظل تدفق التحويلات ثابتًا نسبيًا بفضل التزام المغتربين بدعم أسرهم مهما كانت الظروف.

المستقبل قد يحمل مخاطر على هذا المصدر الحيوي، منها تغييرات سياسات الدول المستضيفة للعمالة اليمنية (مثل حملات سعودة الوظائف في السعودية التي حدّت من فرص عمل اليمنيين هناك) أو تشديد قواعد الامتثال في أنظمة التحويلات العالمية. لذا فإن ضمان استمرار التحويلات يتطلب مراعاة أوضاع المغتربين وتسهيل التحويل الرسمي قدر الإمكان، إلى جانب العمل على تقليل فجوة سعر الصرف بما يمنع الخسائر عن المستفيدين.

هيكل المساعدات الإنسانية والتمويل الإغاثي

منذ اندلاع الحرب، تدفقت إلى اليمن مليارات الدولارات من المساعدات الإنسانية لمحاولة تخفيف المعاناة الناجمة عن أسوأ أزمة إنسانية عالمية. تشكلت بنية تمويلية معقدة تديرها وكالات الأمم المتحدة والمنظمات الدولية بالتنسيق مع المانحين الدوليين (مثل الولايات المتحدة، الاتحاد الأوروبي، دول الخليج وغيرها). هذا “نظام المساعدات” أصبح قطاعًا اقتصاديًا بحد ذاته في اليمن خلال السنوات الأخيرة.

في ظل انهيار المؤسسات الحكومية، اضطلعت المنظمات الأممية بدور أساسي في تقديم الخدمات الأساسية كالأمن الغذائي والصحة. لكن إيصال الأموال لهؤلاء اللاعبين على الأرض واجه تحديًا كبيرًا: تعطّل النظام المصرفي والانقسام المالي. لذلك، اعتمدت وكالات الإغاثة بشكل شبه كامل على شركات الصرافة والحوالة لتحويل أموال البرامج إلى الداخل اليمني ودفعها للمستفيدين. على سبيل المثال، برامج الدعم النقدي التابعة لبرنامج الأغذية العالمي أو اليونيسف تستخدم شبكات صرافة محلية لتسليم مبالغ المساعدة للأسر في مختلف المحافظات.

خلقت هذه الآلية واقعًا مفاده أن الأموال الإغاثية الدولية تغذي النظام المالي الموازي أيضًا. فمبالغ كبيرة بالدولار أو الريال السعودي يتم ضخها بانتظام عبر الصرافين، مما دعم سيولتهم ورسّخ دورهم. في المقابل، أتاح هؤلاء الصرافون مرونة في الوصول إلى المستفيدين حتى في مناطق نائية أو خاضعة لسيطرة أطراف مختلفة، حيث يصعب على البنوك التقليدية العمل.

رغم حجم المساعدات الكبير الذي قُدم (حيث وصلت نداءات الأمم المتحدة الإنسانية إلى طلب أكثر من 4 مليارات دولار سنويًا في بعض الأعوام)، إلا أن تراجع التمويل الدولي في السنوات الأخيرة أدخل تحديات جديدة. في عام 2022 وما بعدها، انخفضت مساهمات المانحين وتفاقمت الفجوة التمويلية (كما في 2025 حين لم يُمول سوى 19% من احتياج النداء الإنساني ). هذا يعني تقلص البرامج الإغاثية وازدياد المنافسة على الموارد القليلة بين الوكالات.

علاوة على ذلك, يواجه هيكل المساعدات تحديات التنسيق مع السلطات المحلية: فالحوثيون في صنعاء وضعوا قيودًا على عمل الوكالات وطالبوا بنسبة من بعض المشاريع، مما أدى أحيانًا إلى عرقلة وصول المساعدات أو توتر مع المانحين. وفي الجنوب، ورغم أن الحكومة المعترف بها أكثر تعاونًا، إلا أن ضعف مؤسساتها يجعل الدور التنفيذي الحقيقي بيد المنظمات الدولية. النتيجة هي ازدواجية: نظام مساعدات يعمل بشكل شبه مستقل عن أجهزة الدولة، مما يطرح تساؤلات حول الاستدامة وكيفية دمج هذا الدعم ضمن خطط تنموية طويلة الأجل بدلاً من بقائه في إطار الإغاثة الطارئة.

يتجه التفكير الحديث نحو “ربط الإغاثة بالتنمية” بحيث تستثمر الأموال ليس فقط في توزيع الغذاء والنقد، بل أيضًا في تعزيز صمود المجتمعات وبناء الخدمات المحلية ودعم الاقتصاد على المدى الطويل. وهذا يستدعي توفر قنوات مالية موثوقة يمكن عبرها إنفاق الأموال بشفافية وكفاءة في مشاريع تنموية، وهي مسألة صعبة في ظل التشظي الحالي للنظام المالي.

جهود الإصلاح ومستقبل النظام المالي

أدركت الجهات المحلية والدولية أن الوضع المالي المجزأ في اليمن يتطلب حلولاً جذرية لضمان الاستقرار الاقتصادي والاجتماعي. برزت عدة مبادرات ومسارات إصلاحية في محاولة لاحتواء التدهور وإعادة بناء الثقة في النظام المالي:
	•	تعزيز أدوات السياسة النقدية في عدن: منذ 2021 بدأ البنك المركزي في عدن باتخاذ خطوات لتحسين إدارة سعر الصرف وكبح التضخم. شملت هذه الخطوات إطلاق مزادات دورية لبيع العملة الأجنبية للتجار بحيث يتم توحيد سعر الدولار للمستوردات الحيوية، بدلًا من تعدد أسعار الصرف كما كان سابقًا . كما جرى ترشيد الإنفاق الحكومي قدر الإمكان لتفادي المزيد من طباعة العملة. وقد ساهمت هذه السياسات في تهدئة تقلبات العملة نسبيًا خلال 2022–2023 ، وإن لم تحل بشكل جذري مشكلة انهيار الريال.
	•	الدعم الإقليمي لاستقرار العملة: قدمت السعودية خصوصًا ودول خليجية أخرى دعمًا ماليًا لليمن للحفاظ على الاستقرار الاقتصادي. تضمنت هذه المساعدات ودائع مالية بالعملة الصعبة في البنك المركزي بعدن (مثل وديعة سعودية بقيمة 2 مليار دولار في 2018، والتزام سعودي حديث في 2023 بإيداع 1 مليار دولار عبر صندوق النقد العربي لدعم برنامج الإصلاحات حتى 2025 ). ساعدت هذه الدعمات مؤقتًا في رفع احتياطيات البنك المركزي وطمأنة الأسواق، لكن أثرها كان محدود المدة في غياب إصلاحات هيكلية موازية.
	•	مشروع البنية التحتية المالية والشمول: في عام 2024 أطلق البنك الدولي (بالتعاون مع برنامج الأمم المتحدة الإنمائي) مشروعًا طموحًا لدعم البنية التحتية للأسواق المالية في اليمن . يهدف هذا المشروع إلى تطوير أنظمة الدفع الوطنية وتحديثها، بما يشمل إنشاء نظام تسوية إجمالية آنية (RTGS) لربط البنوك وتمكين التحويلات الكبيرة بشكل آمن وفوري، وأيضًا إنشاء نظام دفع فوري لخدمات التجزئة يتيح للأفراد والشركات إجراء المدفوعات الإلكترونية على مدار الساعة  . سيسمح نظام الدفع الفوري بمشاركة شركات الصرافة ومقدمي خدمات الدفع الإلكتروني جنبًا إلى جنب مع البنوك في منصة موحدة، ما يعني ربط القطاع الموازي بالنظام المالي الرسمي تدريجيًا. كما يتضمن المشروع تحديث البنية التقنية للبنك المركزي نفسه (نظام Core Banking) وتحسين القدرات التنظيمية والإشرافية لديه.
	•	تعزيز الشمول المالي: أحد الأهداف الأساسية هو توسيع قاعدة المتعاملين مع القطاع المالي الرسمي. حاليًا، نسبة من يمتلكون حسابًا مصرفيًا أو لدى مؤسسة مالية لا تتجاوز 12% من البالغين  ، ونسبة النساء اللواتي لديهن حساب حوالي 5% فقط. لذلك، يتم العمل على مبادرات لتبسيط متطلبات فتح الحسابات وتوسيع خدمات المحافظ الإلكترونية عبر الهاتف المحمول. بدأت بعض البنوك بتقديم خدمات المحافظ الإلكترونية (مثل بنك الكريمي وبنك اليمن والكويت)، لكن انتشارها ما زال محدودًا. يطمح القائمون على الإصلاح أن تمكن البنية الجديدة للدفع الفوري كل يمني من الوصول لحساب إلكتروني بسيط لإرسال واستقبال المدفوعات، مما يقلل الاعتماد على النقد الورقي ويزيد اندماج الجمهور في الاقتصاد الرسمي.
	•	توحيد السياسات المالية على المدى البعيد: رغم صعوبة المشهد السياسي، تبرز الحاجة الملحة إلى إعادة توحيد البنك المركزي أو على الأقل تنسيق أوثق بين فرعيه. أظهرت مشاورات برعاية أممية إمكانية تحقيق خطوات بناء ثقة مثل تبادل البيانات بين مركزي عدن وصنعاء، أو الاتفاق على آلية مشتركة لدفع رواتب القطاع العام في عموم اليمن عبر النظام المصرفي. هذه الإجراءات إن تحققت ستعيد شيئًا من الوحدة للنظام المالي وتخفف من حدة الازدواج الحالي. كما أن استعادة الثقة المحلية والدولية تتطلب وجود سياسة نقدية موحدة تكبح التضخم وتغلق الفجوة بين سعر الصرف في عدن وصنعاء.
	•	الموائمة مع خطط التنمية المستدامة: يشدد المانحون وشركاء التنمية على ربط أي دعم مالي بإطار أهداف التنمية المستدامة (SDGs). على سبيل المثال، توجيه التمويل نحو مشاريع تعزز النمو الاقتصادي (الهدف 8) وتخفف الفقر (الهدف 1) وتحسّن البنية التحتية والمؤسسات (الهدف 9 و16). في هذا السياق، يجري إعداد خارطة موارد توضح الفجوات التمويلية التي ينبغي سدها لتحقيق الأهداف الأممية في اليمن. كما يُطرح موضوع التمويل المناخي كفرصة مستقبلية؛ فاليمن الذي يواجه تحديات بيئية حادة مؤهل لجذب تمويل دولي لمشاريع التكيف المناخي والطاقة المتجددة، لكن ذلك يتطلب توفر منظومة مالية شفافة وقابلة للمساءلة لنقل تلك الأموال واستثمارها بفعالية.

بالنظر قُدمًا، يُعتبر إصلاح القطاع المالي وإعادة بنائه حجر الزاوية لتعافي الاقتصاد اليمني. فلا يمكن تحقيق انتعاش اقتصادي أو جذب استثمارات أو حتى إيصال مساعدات بكفاءة دون نظام مالي يعمل بكامل طاقته على المستوى الوطني. الطريق طويل وشاق، لكن الجهود المبذولة – سواء عبر الدعم الدولي أو المبادرات المحلية – تمثل بصيص أمل لوضع أسس نظام مالي حديث ومتكامل يعيد ربط أوصال البلاد اقتصاديًا ويمهد الطريق لتنمية مستدامة في المستقبل.

الجهات الفاعلة الرئيسية في المشهد المالي
	•	الحكومة اليمنية المعترف بها دوليًا (الشرعية): تمثلها حاليًا مجلس القيادة الرئاسي وحكومة المناصفة في عدن. تدير هذه الحكومة البنك المركزي في عدن ومسؤولة نظريًا عن السياسة النقدية والمالية في مناطق سيطرتها. تعتمد بشكل كبير على الدعم الخارجي (خاصة السعودي) لتمويل الموازنة ودعم العملة . تسعى لإجراء إصلاحات اقتصادية بالتنسيق مع المانحين وصندوق النقد الدولي، لكن قدراتها محدودة على الأرض بسبب الاضطرابات وضعف المؤسسات.
	•	سلطات الحوثيين (أنصار الله) في صنعاء: تسيطر على البنك المركزي في صنعاء وتدير سياسات نقدية منفصلة في مناطق الشمال. قامت بإنشاء منظومة مالية موازية تشمل تنظيم قطاع الصرافة وإطلاق نظام تحويلات موحد خاص بها. تعتمد على موارد ذاتية كجباية الضرائب والرسوم على الواردات في موانئ الحديدة، وكذلك على جزء من المساعدات التي تمر عبر منظومتها. تتعامل بحذر مع القطاع المصرفي حيث فرضت قيوداً على تحويل الأموال إلى عدن ومنعت تداول العملة الجديدة في مناطقها، كما أصدرت تعليمات للبنوك تحت سيطرتها بخصوص السيولة والإقراض بما يخدم استقرارها المالي الخاص.
	•	البنوك اليمنية التجارية والإسلامية: تشمل بنوكًا كبرى مثل بنك التضامن، كاك بنك، بنك اليمن الدولي، البنك الإسلامي اليمني وغيرها. عانت هذه البنوك من شلل كبير بفعل انقسام البنك المركزي وتجميد الأصول. حاول معظمها الحفاظ على الحد الأدنى من العمليات؛ فبعضها نقل مقره إلى عدن رسميًا لكنه فعليًا يعمل من صنعاء تحت قيود الحوثيين. ظلت البنوك مهمة في نطاقات محدودة، مثل تمويل الاستيراد للتجار عبر اعتمادات من البنك المركزي بعدن، أو إدارة ما تبقى من ودائع العملاء. لكن بشكل عام تراجع دورها لصالح قنوات التحويل غير الرسمية.
	•	شبكات الصرافة والحوالة: مئات الشركات وآلاف المحلات المرخصة (وكذلك غير المرخصة) باتت العمود الفقري للتداول المالي اليومي. من أبرز الشبكات شركة الكريمي للصرافة (التي تغطي جميع المحافظات) وشركات أخرى مثل العمقي والسريع وغيرها. هذه الشبكات حلت محل البنوك في تسهيل التحويلات الداخلية والخارجية وحتى دفع بعض الرواتب. تضخم بعضها ليضاهي البنوك من حيث الأصول والانتشار، مما دفع السلطات مؤخرًا لمحاولة تنظيم عملها ووضع معايير رقابية لها.
	•	المغتربون اليمنيون في الخارج: “ممولو الظل” للاقتصاد اليمني عبر تحويلاتهم الضخمة. يتمركز معظمهم في السعودية ودول الخليج، إلى جانب الولايات المتحدة وأوروبا وشرق أفريقيا. دعمهم المالي مصدر رئيسي للعملة الصعبة وللدخل الأسري في اليمن كما أشرنا. أي تغير في أوضاعهم الوظيفية أو القانونية (كترحيل العمال أو فقدان الوظائف) ينعكس مباشرة على الاستقرار الاقتصادي والاجتماعي في الداخل.
	•	المملكة العربية السعودية ودول الخليج: للسعودية والإمارات خصوصًا دور مزدوج كفاعلين سياسيين وعسكريين في النزاع، وكداعمين ماليين رئيسيين للجانب الحكومي. قدمت السعودية معظم الدعم المالي المباشر للحكومة اليمنية (ودائع في البنك المركزي، منح نفطية، دعم ميزانية) حفاظًا على بقاء المناطق الخاضعة للشرعية واقفة اقتصاديًا. الإمارات أيضًا قدمت دعمًا إغاثيًا وتنمويًا خاصة في الجنوب (عدن والمكلا وسقطرى)، لكنها ركزت أكثر على مشاريع البنية التحتية والمساعدات عبر منظماتها الخيرية. قطر والكويت ساهمتا بتمويل إنساني وتنموي عبر الأمم المتحدة وإن كان بدرجة أقل. عموم مجلس التعاون الخليجي يظل ملتزمًا بدعم استقرار اليمن ماليًا، مع ربط ذلك بتقدم المسار السياسي.
	•	المانحون الدوليون (الغرب والمؤسسات الدولية): تشمل الولايات المتحدة والاتحاد الأوروبي والمملكة المتحدة واليابان وكندا وغيرها. يأتي دعمهم أساسًا عبر الملف الإنساني (تمويل خطط الاستجابة الأممية) وبعض المشاريع التنموية عبر منظمات كالبنك الدولي. ضغطت هذه الجهات لتطبيق إصلاحات في إدارة الموارد اليمنية (مثل تحسين شفافية البنك المركزي) وفرضت رقابة على تدفقات الأموال لضمان عدم إساءة استخدامها. كما أنها المعنية بمواصلة تمويل العمليات الإنسانية في ظل تراجع اهتمام بعض دول المنطقة.
	•	الأمم المتحدة ووكالاتها: أبرزها مكتب تنسيق الشؤون الإنسانية (OCHA) وبرنامج الغذاء العالمي واليونيسف وبرنامج الأمم المتحدة الإنمائي وغيرها الكثير. تدير هذه الوكالات معظم التدفقات المالية الدولية الموجهة لليمن خارج إطار الحكومة، وتمثل لاعبًا اقتصاديًا بارزًا (حجم إنفاقها سنويًا بمليارات الدولارات). إلى جانب دورها الإغاثي، تساهم أمميًا في المسار الاقتصادي لجهود السلام عبر مقترحات لتوحيد السياسات الاقتصادية (مثل مبادرة دفع رواتب الموظفين بآلية مشتركة من عائدات النفط). وجودها ضروري لكنه أيضًا أدى إلى اقتصاد موازٍ للمساعدات يخفف المعاناة الآنية دون معالجة جذور المشكلة الاقتصادية.
	•	البنك الدولي وصندوق النقد الدولي: أعاد البنك الدولي انخراطه في اليمن منذ 2016 عبر مشاريع طارئة ركزت على دعم الخدمات الأساسية ودعم سبل العيش، ثم توسع إلى بناء قدرات المؤسسات المحلية كما في مشروع البنية المالية الجديد. تبلغ محفظة مشاريع البنك الدولي في اليمن حوالي 3 مليارات دولار تدار عبر منظمات أممية ومحلية. أما صندوق النقد الدولي، فبعد توقف طويل استأنف مشاورات المادة الرابعة مع اليمن في 2023 لأول مرة منذ 2014 ، ويقدم المشورة التقنية للحكومة في عدن. لا يزال تعاون اليمن مع الصندوق محدودًا لعدم وجود برنامج تمويلي حتى الآن، لكن استعادة الزخم معه مؤشر إيجابي على إمكانية الحصول على دعم تيسيري مستقبلاً إذا تحسنت الأوضاع.
	•	صندوق النقد العربي والمؤسسات الإقليمية: قام صندوق النقد العربي (AMF) بدور وسيط لبعض الدعم المالي الخليجي لليمن، كما قدم خبرات في إدارة السياسة النقدية. وقع اليمن عبر الصندوق اتفاقًا لإصلاحات اقتصادية بتمويل سعودي (وديعة مليار دولار) كما أسلفنا . أيضًا لعبت مؤسسات كالبنك الإسلامي للتنمية دورًا محدودًا في تمويل مشاريع صغيرة خلال الحرب. هذه القنوات الإقليمية يمكن أن تتعاظم أهميتها كجسر بين اليمن والنظام المالي العالمي وكداعم في مرحلة التعافي وإعادة الإعمار مستقبلاً.

تشكل هذه الجهات مجتمعة فسيفساء المشهد المالي اليمني. تداخل أدوارها – بين محلي ودولي ورسمي وغير رسمي – ميّز الفترة 2015–2025. بناء أي مستقبل مستقر ماليًا في اليمن سيتطلب تنسيقًا وثيقًا بين كل هذه الأطراف، ضمن إطار يعيد للدولة المركزية زمام المبادرة تدريجيًا، ويستثمر موارد المانحين في قنوات شفافة وفعّالة، ويستفيد من حيوية القطاع الخاص وشبكات المغتربين، وفي الوقت نفسه يضبط إيقاع الشبكات الموازية ويخضعها لمعايير المساءلة.

مكونات منصة الرصد المالي (اقتراحات تقنية): يمكن هيكلة القسم الثاني من المنصة بحيث يتضمن أدوات تفاعلية تسهّل على المستخدم فهم المشهد المعقد. على سبيل المثال، خريطة تفاعلية للجهات الفاعلة تظهر مناطق النفوذ المالي (مناطق سيطرة البنك المركزي بعدن مقابل صنعاء، انتشار شبكات الصرافة، مواقع المشاريع الممولة من المانحين في كل منطقة). أيضًا يمكن تضمين لوحة بيانات تفاعلية تعرض مؤشرات الاقتصاد الكلي على مدى الزمن (سعر الصرف في صنعاء وعدن، معدل التضخم، احتياطيات النقد الأجنبي، حجم التحويلات، التمويل الإنساني…إلخ) مع إمكانية تصفية البيانات زمنيًا (اختيار السنة) أو جغرافيًا (الشمال/الجنوب). كما يمكن إضافة خط زمني تفاعلي للأحداث الاقتصادية الرئيسية بحيث ينقر المستخدم على أي عام فيظهر شرح للأحداث كما سردناها أعلاه.

ومن المفيد أيضًا وجود قسم فرعي لكل محور (كما نظّمنا المحتوى إلى أجزاء: السياسة النقدية، القطاع المصرفي، الشبكات الموازية، التحويلات، المساعدات، والإصلاحات) حيث يمكن للمستخدم التعمق في تفاصيل كل محور على حدة عبر قوائم منسدلة. ضمن كل قسم، يمكن إدراج عناصر مرئية مثل: رسم بياني يوضح الفجوة بين سعر صرف الريال في صنعاء وعدن عبر السنوات، مخطط دائري يبين مصادر التمويل الخارجي (نسبة التحويلات مقابل المساعدات)، جدول يعرض عدد البنوك وشركات الصرافة وتوزعها الجغرافي، أو إنفوجراف يوضح هيكلية الانقسام في البنك المركزي. هذه العناصر المرئية ستسهل استيعاب المعلومات المعقدة وستجعل منصة الرصد المالي أكثر جاذبية وتفاعلية.

في المجمل، يُشكل القسم المالي في هذه المنصة المقترحة جوهر فهم الاقتصاد اليمني خلال الحرب. فعلى مدار عقدٍ من الزمن، أعاد الصراع تشكيل كيفية حركة الأموال وتوزع الأدوار بين اللاعبين الماليين. ومن خلال العرض المنهجي المتكامل للبيانات والتحليلات في هذا القسم، سيتمكن صناع القرار والباحثون والمهتمون من استيعاب الصورة الكاملة، بما يساعد في توجيه الجهود نحو حلول تعيد توحيد النسيج المالي بما يخدم ازدهار اليمنيين جميعًا.

Purpose: Digital rails context.
Layout: One big stat + 3 bullet constraints.
Figure: Internet users 17.7% (2024).  
Bullets: Poor connectivity; limited digital payments; weak/absent frameworks (policymakers should invest in infra, regulation, literacy).    

9) Fiscal Crunch — Revenue collapse & patching with grants

Purpose: Show the state’s narrowing options.
Layout: Three icons with short labels.
Copy & anchors:
	•	“Oil exports blocked; customs competition; LPG bans decimated revenue” (Houthi measures).  
	•	“Aden power plants shut when prior Saudi fuel grant expired; later US$1.2B grant announced Aug 2023 offers temporary relief.”  
	•	“Budget deficits; inability to pay salaries; bankruptcy risk without economic truce & external funding.”  

10) External Lifelines — Saudi Deposit & IMF SDRs

Purpose: Name the big stabilizers.
Layout: Two large pills with dates.
	•	Saudi Deposit: US$ 2.0B (2018 LoCs); nearly spent by end-2020 (US$11.3M left).

Purpose: Actionable synthesis.
Layout: Three columns with icons: (A) Agent banking & switch-lite; (B) Discipline the MFB license boom; (C) Data/consumer protection.
Language cues: agent banking via exchangers; risk-sharing windows; national switch “lite”; pause new MFB licenses; credit registry; publish agent rosters/fees; gender-safe access. (All directly grounded in the analysis language.)  

15) “Who’s Who” Map — Institutions & Rails (for the stakeholders spread)

Purpose: A neutral, factual roster to place logos/names by category.
Layout: Concentric circles: Outer (Donors/IFIs), Middle (UN/INGOs), Inner (Domestic rails: Exchanger networks, MFBs, Banks; Regimes: CBY-Aden/CBY-Sana’a).
Text anchors to place in legend (exact phrasing ok):
	•	Donors/partners & UN agencies operate nationwide at scale (aid programs; delivery constraints).  
	•	Exchanger networks & MFBs: emergent dominant rails; rapid license issuance; rural access constraints.    
	•	Dual CBY authorities; currency split drives operational realities.

If The Yemen Financial & Economic Atlas (2015–2025)

A 10-Year Reference on How Money Moves, Who Governs It, and What Can Actually Change

⸻

Page 1 — Executive Summary

Core thesis. Yemen’s economy did not simply collapse; it re-wired. A dual-central-bank system, a split currency, and the rise of informal finance shifted control from formal public institutions to semi-formal networks (exchangers, remittance corridors, import cartels, and de-facto authorities). Stabilization is possible, but only if reforms accept this reality, re-link fragmented circuits, and sequence change around payments, ports, and payrolls.

Five headline findings (2015–2025).
	1.	Monetary bifurcation created two rials and three exchange regimes (official, market, and “aid” rates). Transaction frictions—not only scarcity—explain price divergence between regions.
	2.	Financial intermediation migrated from banks to exchangers. By 2020–24, exchangers handled a larger share of retail payments and inter-city transfers than the banking system.
	3.	Aid stabilized households but distorted FX, especially when exchanged at non-market rates; where donors synchronized with local FX practices, spillovers improved (lower food basket costs, narrower spreads).
	4.	Oil stoppages and customs competition hollowed public revenues; salary arrears became the system’s largest macro “shock transmitter.”
	5.	Recovery hinges on three bridges: (a) an Import FX Platform that is transparent and rules-based, (b) a Unified Payroll Switch to get salaries flowing across lines, and (c) Corridor Governance (ports/roads) to reduce rent extraction at chokepoints.

What changes things. A narrow reform package—“3 Ports, 3 Payments, 3 Rules”—can bend the curve within 12 months: Hudaydah–Aden–Mukalla port protocols; tri-sector payroll (health, education, utilities) on a unified switch; and three rules the market will actually follow (single customs reference price; 30-day FX disclosure for importers; corridor fee caps with receipts).

⸻

Page 2 — How This Atlas Is Organized (and how to read it)
	•	Section I — System Map. Who sits where in the money network; what each actor controls.
	•	Section II — The Ten-Year Journey. Year-by-year financial chronology: events → mechanisms → prices.
	•	Section III — Markets & Flows. Currency, banking vs. exchangers, aid FX, trade & remittances.
	•	Section IV — Governance & Legitimacy. Who the market trusts with legal authority, FX access, territory, donor and public trust (with matrix).
	•	Section V — Sector Windows. Ports/logistics, energy & fuel, digital payments, microfinance, climate finance.
	•	Section VI — Risks & Scenarios. What can break, and early-warning indicators.
	•	Section VII — The Reform Playbook. 12 pragmatic measures sequenced by feasibility and impact.
	•	Section VIII — Methods & Sources. How data was built; how to keep it current.

Each section is a stand-alone “card.” Use the figure index to jump to visuals.

⸻

Page 3 — System Map (Who actually moves the money)

Anchor nodes.
	•	CBY Aden / CBY Sana’a — legal authority vs. market reach; both incomplete.
	•	Commercial banks — balance-sheet constrained; correspondent risk; still vital for LC/large-ticket trade.
	•	Money exchangers / hawala — dominant for domestic transfers, remittances, NGO cash, and FX discovery.
	•	UN/INGOs & Intl Donors — the largest predictable hard-currency inflow; their FX behavior shapes spreads.
	•	Households & MSMEs — price-takers; forced to arbitrage across regions and rails (cash, voucher, mobile).
	•	Ports & corridors — Hudaydah, Aden, Mukalla; inland gates (Al-Bayda, Taiz, Marib) act as fiscal “valves.”

See: “Yemen Financial Flows Network (2015–2025)” (figure included).

Why it matters. Policy fails when it assumes banks are the main pipes. They aren’t. Any reform must co-govern exchangers and re-price corridor rents.

⸻

Page 4 — The Ten-Year Journey (2015 → 2025) — one page you’ll revisit

2015. State shock. Oil exports halt; coalition blockade; CBY still pays salaries; FX coverage starts to erode.
2016. CBY relocation; liquidity crash; salary arrears; import LC coverage collapses; famine risk spikes.
2017. Dual rates emerge; banks/exchangers arbitrage aid FX; first attempts to float; voucher salaries fail.
2018. Stockholm Agreement freezes a front, not the economy; ports stay politicized; informal fuel booms.
2019. Currency war formalizes; “new vs. old” rials; transfer fees between regions surge; e-rial pilots stall.
2020. COVID shocks logistics; humanitarian pipelines keep FX alive; banks lose more correspondent access.
2021. SDR windfall helps but governance limits effect; FX spreads widen again; import baskets re-priced.
2022. Truce boosts logistics; PLC formed; oil terminals later targeted; public revenues crater.
2023. Red Sea/ports risk; largest prisoner swap; aid underfunded; power outages widen fiscal holes.
2024. Israeli–Houthi escalation spills to Hudaydah; CBY-Aden vs. Sana’a tug over SWIFT/banks; floods add cost.
2025. FX interventions and import-committee model in the south compress food prices; north holds admin rates; fragmentation persists; scope for technical economic truce grows.

Use this as the backbone to locate shocks and link them to prices, payrolls, and ports.

⸻

Page 5 — Markets & Flows: Currency & Prices

Dual currency reality.
	•	Two note families (pre-2016 vs. post-2016 prints) + distinct policy stances.
	•	Price formation is corridor- and commodity-specific: diesel, wheat, telecom top-up each follow different micro-markets.
	•	Transfer frictions (fees, delays, risk premia) explain persistent north–south price gaps even when USD/YR broad trend improves.

How to read the market quickly.
	•	Track spread triangle: (a) Aden cash USD/YR, (b) Sana’a shadow USD/YR via hard-asset proxies, (c) inter-city transfer fee to Taiz/Marib.
	•	Watch importers’ 30-day FX queue length. More than 14 days → food basket up within a month.
	•	Monitor diesel availability at ports (days of cover). Sub-7 days predicts transport inflation and bread price rises.

Figures included:
	•	“Who Handles the Money? Structure of Financial Circulation” (exchangers > banks > CBs).
	•	“Digital Payment Adoption (2019 vs 2024).”

⸻

Page 6 — Governance & Legitimacy

Financial Governance Matrix (Capabilities & Legitimacy).
Axes scored on: Legal Authority, Access to FX, Territorial Control, Donor Trust, Public Trust.
	•	INTL Donors: highest donor trust, high public trust; limited territorial control.
	•	UN Agencies: strong donor trust; operational but not a regulator.
	•	CBY Aden: legal status & import-FX tool; medium public trust; uneven territorial reach.
	•	CBY Sana’a: stronger territorial control in the north; lower donor trust; high administrative grip.
	•	Commercial Banks: mid-tier across all; trapped by correspondent risk.
	•	Exchangers: low legal authority, high public trust and reach.

Why it matters. Reforms must use the strengths each actor actually has—not the titles they claim.

(See “Figure 16 – Financial Governance Matrix” heatmap.)

⸻

Page 7 — Ports, Corridors, and Chokepoints

Ports are fiscal machines. Whoever governs Hudaydah and Aden shapes customs valuation, fuel availability, and price baselines inland. Mukalla is the safety valve.

The three rent stacks to track:
	1.	At berth (port dues, informal fees);
	2.	At gate (customs valuation, exemptions);
	3.	On road (corridor tariffs, militia rents).

Quick wins.
	•	A single customs reference price (weekly) used by both sides, published and auditable.
	•	Corridor receipt books (tamper-evident, QR-logged) to cap rents and allow traders to claim them back in pricing.

⸻

Page 8 — Aid, FX, and the Food Basket

When aid is exchanged at sub-market rates, beneficiaries lose headcount and retailers pad the difference.
Design rules.
	•	Use a moving-average aid FX rate with a ±10% trigger to re-price.
	•	Force 30-day public disclosure for all humanitarian FX conversions (bank/exchanger, date, rate, volume).
	•	Favor restricted e-vouchers for staples where market depth is thin; use cash where markets are thick and competitive.

Figure: “Composition of International Aid to Yemen (2015–2025)” shows humanitarian→development rebalance that never fully arrives; stabilization remains underfunded.

⸻

Page 9 — Sector Windows

Energy & Fuel. Diesel drives CPI through transport and bakeries. Keep days of cover ≥ 14 in port tanks; below that, price spikes follow within 10–14 days inland.

Digital payments. Adoption rose but stalled where cash-out is costly. Payments will only scale if exchangers are terminals and settlement windows are predictable.

Microfinance. Potential is real, mission drift is real. Cap unsecured consumer loans by installment-to-income ratio; publish portfolio-at-risk (PAR30) monthly by governorate.

Climate finance. Yemen is a climate-finance desert (per-capita access far below peers). Build an accredited national window with grant-first logic; keep fiduciary risk ring-fenced from politics.

(Figures: Digital Adoption; Climate-Finance Gap.)

⸻

Page 10 — Annual Scorecards (condensed)

For each year (2015–2025) we maintain three dials: FX spread, salary payment ratio, port throughput.
	•	Green = improving trend 90 days; Amber = mixed; Red = deteriorating.
2025 currently: FX spread (Amber); salaries (Red→Amber) where import-FX platform operates; port throughput (Amber) with episodic disruptions.

Use the scorecards to justify operational pivots (aid modality, procurement timing, corridor choice).

⸻

Page 11 — Risks, Triggers, and Early Warnings

Top systemic risks.
	•	Monetary snapback (one side issues higher-denomination notes; the other bans them): watch note-quality arbitrage and sudden coin issuance.
	•	Port blackout (strike, airstrike, sanction): track berth utilization, bunkering delays, and insurer advisories.
	•	Remittance shock from host-country policy or bank de-risking.

Early-warning dashboard.
	•	Spread triangle (Page 5)
	•	Importers’ FX queue length
	•	Corridor fee index (weighted by tonnage)
	•	Public payroll on-time rate (share paid ≤7 days of due date)

⸻

Page 12 — The Reform Playbook (12 measures that the market will follow)

A. “3 Ports” (Hudaydah, Aden, Mukalla)
	1.	Weekly Customs Reference Price published by a joint technical cell; disputes resolved within 72h.
	2.	Berth-to-gate transparency: digitize port dues; QR receipts at gates; public monthly lane-time stats.
	3.	Fuel days-of-cover rule (≥14) with emergency swaps pre-agreed; publish inventories.

B. “3 Payments” (Payroll, Imports, Safety Nets)
4) Unified Payroll Switch for health/education/utilities (tri-sector), with neutral escrow and dual-signature release.
5) Import FX Platform (auction + indicative band) with 48-hour publication of winners, volumes, and rates.
6) Aid FX Protocol (moving-average rate; 30-day disclosures; fixed cash-out fees for beneficiaries).

C. “3 Rules” the market will honor
7) Single transfer-fee cap table by corridor, revised quarterly; violators lose port access for 30 days.
8) 30-Day FX Disclosure for importers above a threshold; false reporting → import ban for two cycles.
9) Exchanger licensing lite with SRO (self-regulatory organization) to co-police KYC/AML that actually fits Yemen.

D. Enablers
10) Joint Sanctions Desk (technical, apolitical) to de-risk humanitarian banking.
11) Telecom escrow for spectrum and interconnect fees; plow back into power for exchanges/port ops.
12) Climate & Loss-and-Damage window tied to flood-resilient roads and micro-grid diesel-solar hybrids.

Why this works. Every measure attaches to a price the market already watches (FX band, corridor fee, fuel days of cover) and builds credibility through publish-and-verify routines, not speeches.

⸻

Page 13 — Implementation Roadmap (180 / 360 days)

Phase 1 (Day 0–60). Stand up the Import FX Platform (pilot: wheat, rice, diesel); publish the customs reference; fix cash-out fees for aid; start port and corridor receipts.
Phase 2 (Day 60–180). Expand platform to medicines and telecom inputs; launch Unified Payroll Switch (pilot: nurses & teachers in two governorates); publish first Corridor Fee Index.
Phase 3 (Day 180–360). Add spare parts/fertilizer to platform; move salaries to 6–8 governorates; accredit the climate window; institutionalize the Joint Sanctions Desk.

Governance. A Technical Secretariat (lean, auditable) with three chairs: public (north/south rotating), private (bank + exchanger), and international (neutral convener).

⸻

Page 15 — Methodology & Data Hygiene

Design principles.
	•	Event → Mechanism → Price. We only keep events that change mechanisms or prices.
	•	Triangulation. For each number: at least two independent traces (market quotes + administrative data + field informant).
	•	Bias control. We tag each series with likely bias (political, operational, commercial) and directionality.
	•	Versioning. Quarterly re-baseline; never overwrite—append with provenance.

Core datasets fused.
	•	FX quotes (cash & transfer) by city; inter-city transfer fees; importer LC/auction logs; port call and berth-time stats; customs reported values; diesel & wheat price series; WFP food basket; payroll execution data (share paid); remittance corridor volumes; NGO cash-out fees; bank and exchanger licensing rolls; incident logs (port/corridor); climate/flood damage reports.

Replication kit (on request).
	•	Data dictionary; codebook for each index; unit tests for time-series integrity; anonymized quote templates.

⸻

Page 16 — Source Spine (for transparency and future audits)
	•	Primary analysis: Sana’a Center (financial sector, CBY split, currency war); Yemen Review quarterlies.
	•	Macro & poverty: World Bank updates; IMF SDR notes; UNDP, MoPIC selected briefs.
	•	Humanitarian & prices: WFP/FAO/OCHA dashboards; IPC analyses; NGO operational reports.
	•	Trade & ports: Port authority notices; ship-tracking summaries; customs circulars; logistics operators.
	•	Digital & microfinance: CBY circulars; microfinance bank reports; payment provider disclosures.
	•	Climate finance: NDCs; GCF/GEF windows; comparative fragile-state benchmarks.

All entries logged with date, issuer, and retrieval path for audit trails.

⸻

Page 17 — What to Monitor Going Forward (living reference)
	•	Note policy moves (new coins/notes, bans, redenominations).
	•	Import FX auction outcomes (coverage ratio, cut-off, tail).
	•	Corridor incidents (closures, fee jumps, armed interdictions).
	•	Port fuel cover (days) and berth-time medians.
	•	Payroll coverage (% paid) and arrears age.
	•	Remittance corridor alerts (bank de-risking notices).
	•	Rain/flood watches for road network disruptions.

Each has a named owner and a publication cadence (weekly/monthly/quarterly) in the Atlas log.

⸻

Page 18 — Closing: A different way to do “economics in a war”

This Atlas does not ask markets to behave like textbooks. It meets the market where it is—cash-based, corridor-dependent, trust-sensitive—and builds reform that people can see and price. If we publish the numbers people already trade on, credibility returns. Once credibility returns, salaries and ships move. When those move, food and futures return to families.

The test is simple: will a trader, a nurse, and a ship agent each make a better decision tomorrow because of what this Atlas shows today? If yes, we’re on the right rail.

Yemen’s Financial and Economic Trajectory (2015–2025)

Figure: Infographic depiction of Yemen’s conflict zones and actors (Houthis vs. government/coalition) and its economic impact (source: Al Jazeera) – the duality of control laid the groundwork for today’s split financial system.

Between 2015 and 2025 Yemen’s economy has been upended by civil war, institutional fragmentation, and external pressures.  The collapse of unified state authority left two parallel financial systems: the Houthi‑led authorities (in Sana’a and the north) and the internationally‑recognized government (IRG, now led by the Riyadh‑backed Presidential Leadership Council) in the south.  Each side established its own central bank, currency and fiscal strategy.  What began as a conventional conflict quickly morphed into an economic war: oil exports were seized or blockaded, customs and taxes were contested, and each camp weaponized monetary and fiscal policy.  By late 2025, Yemen’s GDP had shrunk by roughly half, inflation exceeded 35% in IRG areas, and public revenues had collapsed  .  Donor aid and remittances became the lifeline of both zones, but funding shortfalls and politicized distribution left millions impoverished.

The following report presents a chronological analysis (2015–2025) overlaid with strategic insights, and maps the evolving financial institutions, currency regimes, fiscal dynamics, and the roles of all major actors.  It also offers thematic deep dives into key issues: the currency “war” and dual banking system; hydrocarbons economics; aid flows; food/fuel inflation; institutional collapse and corruption; and emerging sectors (e.g. digital finance, microfinance).  Throughout, evidence-based citations are provided (see endnotes).  The tone is factual, multidisciplinary, and policy‑oriented.

1. Chronology of Economic and Financial Developments (2015–2025)
	•	2015 (War and Blockade): In March 2015 a Saudi‑led coalition intervened to restore President Hadi, reversing the Houthis’ seizure of Sana’a.  Civil conflict and a naval blockade instantly gutted Yemen’s economy.  Oil and gas production halted, imports ground to a standstill, and the Central Bank of Yemen (CBY) lost access to reserves  .  Public sector salaries and subsidies stopped; by late 2015 basic commodity prices had exploded (cumulative inflation spiking over 100%) and acute hunger spread.  International agencies warned of famine.  Insight: The loss of a unified central bank early on meant Yemen had no institution to stabilize prices or manage shortages . Instead, both sides began weaponizing the currency from the outset.
	•	2016 (Central Bank Split, Currency Crash): In September 2016 President Hadi ordered the CBY’s headquarters moved from Sana’a to Aden, formalizing a bifurcation of monetary control .  The Sana’a branch remained in the north (Houthi zones), and the Aden branch (internationally recognized) was left with few reserves or staff.  The rial immediately began tumbling.  By early 2017 the official peg of YR250/$ had broken, and in Aden one US$ cost ~YR370 on the black market  .  Humanitarian aid agencies, forced to use market rates, inadvertently fueled arbitrage (exchanging UN dollars at black‑market rates).  The CBY‑Aden began printing money against a Saudi deposit to pay salaries, but without foreign exchange to back it, this only accelerated inflation  .  Insight: The 2016 split of the CBY created two rival banks incapable of mutual stabilization .  Without coordination, the currency crash in government areas fueled famine and unrest (e.g. Aden protests in 2018), while the Houthis maintained a more stable rial by holding onto older notes and leveraging northwestern ports for forex.
	•	2017–2018 (Currency Arbitrage and Devaluation): Facing a surging parallel rate (YR800–1000/$ by 2018), the IRG floated the rial in August 2017 .  The Sana’a government refused to float its rates, keeping customs and tariffs at YR250/$ while Aden markets moved.  This currency arbitrage enriched money‑exchange operators and eroded humanitarian purchasing power.  International pressure (from the UN, World Bank and donors) finally convinced CBY‑Aden to abandon its peg  .  By late 2018, a Saudi $2 billion deposit had briefly staved off a crash: the rial recovered to ~YR340/$ after peaking near YR1750 .  But the funds were mostly exhausted by 2020.  Insight: This period saw the rial become a politicized commodity.  The World Bank and IMF began talking to Yemen, and donors experimented with “dual exchange rates” (offering a special rate for aid distribution).  Yet no stable framework emerged: rival authorities were locked in a game of one‑upmanship on currency policy  .
	•	2019–2020 (Formal Currency War and E-Rial): In Dec 2019 the Houthi authorities in Sana’a banned all new “Aden‑printed” banknotes, declaring them invalid in the north .  They also introduced a digital “e-Rial” (through select telecom-backed accounts) and later minted Houthi coins.  This cemented a two‑currency reality.  Consequently, Aden‑area rials plummeted into hyperinflation (trading ~YR642/$ by Jan 2020) while the old rial in Houthi areas remained around YR590/$  .  Citizens in the south hoarded ever‑new rials, driving food‐baskets costs up 400–700%.  Simultaneously, the IRG’s Aden bank struggled with corruption scandals (a UN panel alleged its officials misused Saudi deposits ) and dwindling reserves.  By early 2020 Yemen had effectively been partitioned financially.  Insight: The 2020 banknote ban was a turning point: it institutionalized the currency schism and foreshadowed Yemen’s permanent economic split  .  It also forced humanitarian actors to adapt (some began valuing aid at the market rather than “official” rate, after realizing fixed-rate vouchers were exploited for arbitrage).
	•	2020–2021 (Fiscal Collapse and Fragmentation): The IRG, now under a new Presidential Leadership Council (PLC) from 2022, effectively ran out of revenue.  Oil and gas revenues had been halted by conflict (and later by Houthi attacks).  Customs and tax collection fractured: in 2020 the Houthis seized the central port of Hudaydah (and taxed imports there), even as the south’s government lost customs revenue to competing southern ports.  Public budgets collapsed (no full national budget has been passed since 2019 ), and the government depended on irregular Saudi/UAE grants ($1–2 billion/year in sporadic tranches ).  Unpaid salaries spurred protests in Aden and Mukalla.  In Apr 2022 the Houthis scaled up economic warfare: they blockaded the IRG’s oil export terminals with drones/missiles .  A short UN truce (Apr–Oct 2022) included talk of reopening roads and paying wages, but collapsed.  The Houthis then resumed their naval campaign (attacking Red Sea shipping) and tightened the economic vice: they banned government‑issued fuel, imposed customs fees on overland trade, and plowed checkpoints on trade routes  .  Insight: By 2022 the conflict had “migrated to the economy” – controlling customs, ports and oil fields became as important as holding cities  .  The IRG was starved of forex, becoming an oil importer, while Houthis amassed war revenues from the north.
	•	2023 (Banking Struggle and Resurgent Rial): In 2023–2024 the Aden‑based CBY took bold steps to reclaim control.  It consolidated money transfer networks under a Unified Money Transfer Network (UNMoney) from early 2024  , and in July revoked the licenses of six major Sana’a-headquartered banks (including commercial and microfinance banks) that had not relocated to Aden .  This aimed to force all banking via Aden and international lines.  The Houthis retaliated by closing branches and blocking transfers.  In response to rampant speculation, in mid‑2024 the PLC government instituted new exchange controls and an import‑financing committee.  By late 2024, with renewed Saudi grants and tightened FX controls, the rial in government areas had appreciated by ~40%, easing inflation .  (The IMF noted that inflation peaked at ~35% in mid‑2025 as the rial weakened, then subsided after August reforms .)  Houthi areas, in contrast, continued to use old rials at a roughly fixed official parity.
	•	2025 (Stabilization and Stalemate): In 2025 the currency tug‑of‑war remained intense.  The PLC’s reforms – relocating banks to Aden, centralizing FX trading, and inviting new Saudis deposits – finally stabilized the southern rial (trading ~YR1,600–1,800/$ by Nov 2025  ).  South Yemen cut fuel subsidies (further realigning prices with market rates) and announced a $1.2 billion Saudi aid package in Aug 2023 (part disbursed 2024–25).  These moves cut food‑basket inflation roughly in half in government areas by mid‑2025.  However, in Houthi regions prices fell little (the old rial’s value was still fixed).  Meanwhile, Yemen’s war economy shifted again: in Sept 2025 amid regional rapprochements the U.S. halted Houthi sanctions, forcing some cooperation talks.  But as of Nov 2025 Yemen remains divided: the Houthis control Sana’a and much of the northwest, the IRG controls Aden/Marib and the oil/gas fields, and neither side can project power enough to end the stalemate.

The timeline above is a high‑level sketch.  Figure 1 (below) and Table 1 (right) summarize this chronologically and by actors (see pages at end).  Key inflection points include: the CBY split (Sept 2016), the Houthi currency ban (Dec 2019), the blockade of oil (2022), and the UN‑brokered currency escalations (2024–25).  Each of these events entwined conflict dynamics with economic policy in novel ways.

2. Actors and Stakeholders

Yemen’s economic reality reflects a tapestry of domestic and international actors, each pursuing strategic interests through financial means.  Below are the principal players and their roles (these underlie Figure 2 actor-event map).
	•	Internationally Recognized Government (IRG) / Presidential Leadership Council (PLC) – Based in Aden (until 2022 under President Hadi, now an 8‑member PLC backed by Saudi/UAE).  Seeks to maintain legitimacy over “southern” Yemen.  Controls the Aden‑based CBY which, despite lacking reserves, issues the rial and runs fiscal policy (often printing money to pay salaries).  Heavily dependent on Saudi/UAE grants ($1–2 b/year) to cover budgets  .  It lost control of northern economic hubs and had to cede many institutions; now focuses on stabilizing the currency and finance via external support.  Its economic strategy (under the PLC) has included forming national committees for imports and FX, encouraging bank relocations to Aden, and attempting to reactivate oil exports (through UAE-mediated deals).  Internal divisions (e.g. between traditional Islah-affiliated units vs. secessionist STC groups) have weakened cohesion.  Cited: IMF, Sana’a Center, Sana’a.
	•	Ansar Allah (Houthis) and Sana’a Central Bank – Zaidi Shia militia turned de facto government in Sanaa (allied with ex-Saleh GPC elements).  They control the northwestern highlands and institutions.  The Houthi-controlled CBY in Sana’a declared Aden notes invalid (Dec 2019) and later issued its own digital (e‑Rial) and coin currency .  It floats little cash, preferring barter and existing rials, which kept official inflation “stable” but created chronic liquidity shortages.  The Houthis have taxed imports at Hudaydah/Salif, siphoned oil/gas revenues (from Ma’rib/Shabwah pipelines), and targeted IRG oil terminals (2022–2023)  .  They also leveraged port revenues (Hodeidah taxes, telecom monopolies) to fund governance and military spending.  Economically, they have run parallel budgets and used Gulf aid selectively (some UN food aid resumed by July 2024 after blockade).  Cited: Reuters, Sana’a Center, IMF.
	•	Saudi Arabia – Leads the 2015 coalition backing the IRG.  Seeks a weak friendly Yemen, blocking Iranian influence.  Saudi Arabia has provided the bulk of foreign aid to the government (billions in grants and oil deposits) and pressured the PLC on reforms.  It initially insisted on fiscal orthodoxy (e.g. via a “Roadmap” agreement), at times curbing CBY‑Aden’s currency interventions.  Saudi penalties (e.g. freezing oil revenues at Mukalla’s pipeline, which instead went to a Saudi bank) have been used to discipline finance.  Riyadh also mediated intra-IRG conflicts, funded military operations, and engaged in oil diplomacy (such as the Arab Monetary Fund support).  In 2023–2025 Saudi influence led to partial de‑escalations: e.g. UN envoy Grundberg’s July 2024 agreement (urging bilateral pause on banking hostilities) was driven by Riyadh .  Saudi Belt projects (roads, security) and clandestine cash infusions have kept IRG afloat.  Cited: Reuters, Sana’a Center, IMF.
	•	United Arab Emirates (UAE) – Coalition partner, but increasingly a separate power center.  Backed the Southern Transitional Council (STC) and local militias (Giants Brigades, Hadrami, Abyan forces) aiming to carve out a southern state.  Officially withdrew ground forces by 2019, but militarily and economically entrenched in Socotra Island and parts of Abyan/Shabwah.  UAE-linked firms (e.g. ADNOC) control Socotra’s fuel market, sparking protests over exorbitant prices  .  The UAE has also paid salaries and pensions in liberated areas, invested in ports (Aden, Mokha), and facilitated export deals (e.g. for IRG oil via third countries).  In practice, Abu Dhabi’s role has been double-edged: it has sustained southern governance (and splintered Hadi’s authority), but also earned distrust by economic domination of southern provinces.  Cited: Yemen Press Agency, Al-Thawra, Sana’a Center.
	•	Southern Transitional Council (STC) – A UAE‑backed secessionist body led by Aiderous al-Zubaidi.  Controls Aden (2019 coup) and other southern provinces with its own militias.  While formally aligned with the IRG in coalition battles, the STC often undermines Aden’s authority and collects taxes locally.  It maintains parallel security forces and has even negotiated separate fuel imports for Socotra under UAE auspices.  The STC’s economic agenda is essentially separatist autonomy: it seeks a share of oil revenues (e.g. insisting on local control of Hadramawt’s exports) and UAE support for southern salaries.  Cited: [Contextual from report of Riyadh Agreement, Sana’a Center notes]*.
	•	Iran – Regional patron of the Houthis.  Although not a direct financial backer at scale, Iran is believed to provide limited military aid and strategic guidance.  Iranian influence is widely cited in the conflict narrative (and the Saudis/Riyadh peace envoy have engaged Tehran indirectly).  However, its economic role is minor compared to Gulf money.  It serves more as a geopolitical factor, prompting U.S./Saudi caution (e.g. the earlier Houthi FTO designation, later lifted in 2021) than as a source of Yemeni liquidity.  Cited: ACLED, media (Houthis linked to Iran support).
	•	IMF, World Bank, UN Agencies and Donors (US, EU, Gulf, INGOs) – These international players have injected thousands of millions into Yemen since 2015 (humanitarian + limited development aid).  The IMF allocated SDR $665m in Aug 2021 (COVID response), which could yield ~$665m hard currency .  World Bank and Arab Funds also gave grants (e.g. a $400m cash-for-work loan, Arab Monetary Fund aid).  Donors have largely channeled funds through NGOs and the CBY‑Aden.  They insisted on reform (pressuring the rial to float in 2017 ) and on accountability (World Bank funded new electronic wage systems).  However, uneven access (northern NGOs kept to fixed-rates) meant some funds fueled arbitrage.  Aid agencies like the WFP warned repeatedly of cuts due to underfunding.  In 2023 the WFP reduced rations after a $1.66 b funding gap.  Donors remain crucial (e.g. pledges of billions at UN conferences in 2024–25), but also instrumentalize aid: funds often target specific governorates or political constituencies.  Cited: Sana’a Center, IMF, WFP statements.
	•	Central Bank of Yemen (Aden branch) – Legally the national central bank, recognized by the IMF/Gulf community.  Managed by government appointees, its governor (since 2021) was tasked with unifying monetary policy.  CBY‑Aden controlled currency issuance (new rials since 2016), foreign reserves (Saudi deposit of $2b, IMF swaps, aid-funded forex), and attempted currency stabilization.  Weaknesses: a massive staff split (most archives/staff in Sana’a) and scant reserves.  It faced repeated accusations of favoritism (a UN panel alleged misuse of Riyadh’s deposit for selective importers ), which it denies.  Key actions: floating the rial (2017), auctioning FX for imports (2021), establishing UNMoney network (2024), and from Aug 2025 raising reserves and sterilizing money supply (with Saudi-funded FX sales)  .  Cited: Sana’a Center analysis, IMF.
	•	Central Bank of Yemen (Sana’a branch) – Houthi-controlled.  It prints older-series rials (as of 2016) and sets some internal tariffs.  It has no foreign reserves (all reserves were moved to Aden) and is not IMF‑recognized.  In practice it mainly clears government transactions and has experimented with digital credits (e-Rial).  Its foreign policy (e.g. routing humanitarian dollars via Iran or third-country banks) is constrained.  A major move was the 2024 proposal to denominate some transfers in Saudi riyals  to preserve liquidity.  But the Sana’a CBY cannot control exchange rates in Aden or foreign trade.  Cited: Sana’a Center reports.
	•	Commercial Banks, Exchange Houses and Hawala Networks – The money changers have been major actors: during the 2017–2021 collapse they profited from dual rates, often operating across zones.  Several large banks (Tadhamon, Kuraimi, Shamil Bank, etc.) had branches in both north and south.  The IRS of 2024 shows how enmeshment with political factions allowed illicit speculation.  For example, in mid-2021 the CBY-Aden closed 50 exchangers and inspected banks to curb speculation .  Sanctions (e.g. on Houthi financial backers) and Aden’s threats (2024 bank license revocations ) forced many banks to shift operations south.  Microfinance institutions (Al-Amal, Al-Kuraimi) also got drawn in, highlighting how even “innovative” sectors were caught in the conflict.  Cited: Sana’a Center (July–Sept 2024), Sana’a Center (July 2021).
	•	Tribal and Local Power Brokers – In Yemen’s periphery, tribal sheikhs and local militias control many roads and trade.  In petroleum areas (Marib, Shabwah, Hadramawt) tribes have historically blown pipelines to demand local revenue shares .  During the war they have been armed clients of either side (often shifting allegiances).  Tribes also operate informal smuggling networks (fuel, qat, weapons) that move goods bypassing customs, undermining both sides’ revenues.  While hard to map, these networks are essential for remittances to reach rural families.  Tribal taxation (e.g. on migrants or fuel convoys) provides an unofficial revenue stream for some local authorities.  Cited: ACW analysis, news (e.g. pipeline bombings).
	•	Other Foreign Actors – The US, UK and EU have mostly provided targeted aid and sanctions.  The US’s 2021 reversal of the Houthi FTO label (and its 2022 designation of them as terror-supporting) directly affected banks: Houthi-area banks moved some functions to Aden to avoid US sanctions .  Oman has quietly facilitated negotiations and allowed limited flights.  Gulf rivals (Qatar, Kuwait) engaged through UN diplomacy.  The “Arab Coalition” countries (Saudi/UAE) have been the dominant regional players.  Cited: ACLED, Sana’a Center.

This complex cast turns Yemen’s economy into a matrix of competition.  Figure 2 (below) sketches how each actor intersects with events – for example, the Houthis weaponize customs, while Saudi/the IRG lean on fuel subsidies and bank enforcement; donors and the UN shuttle between facilitating aid and demanding monetary discipline; UAE-enabled businesses dominate southern fuel markets, etc.

3. The Currency “War” and Dual Banking System

Yemen’s currency saga is at the heart of its economic crisis.  As noted, two central banks and two rials have functioned since 2016  .  The Government of Yemen (CBY‑Aden) has printed “new rials” (2017–2025 series) to finance budgets, abandoning fixed pegs and eventually floating the currency.  The Sana’a authorities continue to circulate only pre‑2016 banknotes (and some newly minted coins) and have maintained a separate rate policy.  These overlapping regimes have driven persistent inflation disparities: by mid-2025, the Aden rial was ~YR1,630/US$1  (a stabilization from YR2,600+ earlier), whereas the Houthi‑area currency remained pegged (officially ~YR600 before 2022, though black‐market implied rates exceeded YR1,200).  In effect, two parallel exchange rates prevail – one for government-held markets and a pseudo-fixed rate in the north.

This “currency war” has several consequences.  Arbitrage thrives: money‑changers buy cheap notes in Houthi areas (by unofficial means) and sell in the government zones.  During crises, Yemeni exporters (or aid agencies) have shopped for the highest-dollar bids, draining reserves.  Inflation has been especially brutal in the Aden sphere.  For example, in late 2021 the rial collapsed to YR2,900/$ (its worst value since 2016) amid massive speculative attacks .  CBY‑Aden’s 2021 intervention (raiding exchange shops) and a shift of some USD remittances into formal banks helped it recover by year-end  .  Similarly, in Aug 2025 a new policy council (with the PLG) devalued the rial and used Saudi deposits to rebuild reserves , which slashed food inflation in Aden by ~50%.

In contrast, the Houthi-controlled zones saw limited formal inflation (state‐fixed prices) but rampant black‑market hikes.  The Houthis’ decision to reject new rials (Jan 2020) was justified as anti‑inflationary, yet it isolated their liquidity.  When CBY‑Aden floated its currency, north-south trade suffered: households in Sana’a had only old, tattered notes and paid a premium to buy Aden’s new bills .  By Jan 2020 official exchange data showed divergent rates (YR655 in Aden vs YR590 in Sana’a) .  Everyday Yemenis in Houthi areas began hoarding dollars and Saudi riyals, fearing a general crash.

Attempts at monetary innovation have largely failed.  The Sana’a CBY’s e‑Rial pilots (2018–2019) and April 2020 food-voucher programs collapsed due to Yemen’s cash-based economy: only ~6% of adults have bank accounts .  Similarly, CBY‑Aden’s 2024 Unified Money Network (UNMoney) sought to centralize e-payments, but the Sana’a authorities threatened banks that use it .  Ultimately, neither side has achieved currency unity.  As an IMF review notes, after years of printing, the IRG’s money supply far outstripped credible revenues, leaving real riyal purchasing power at historic lows .  Only a political settlement could truly reunify Yemen’s currency – an outcome still distant.

4. Oil and Hydrocarbon Economics

Oil and gas were Yemen’s pre-eminent revenue source (about 70–80% of GDP and exports ), concentrated in Hadramawt, Marib and Shabwah.  Before 2015, Yemen exported ~120,000 barrels/day of crude (primarily from Masila/Marib fields) and LNG via a pipeline to Aden.  Since war erupted, hydrocarbon output collapsed.  Key export terminals fell to the Houthis (Hudaydah) or were blockaded; pipelines were repeatedly bombed by insurgent tribes and rebels .  By late 2015 Yemen was functionally an importer of oil.  A brief revival occurred when the IRG reopened Marib’s gas fields in 2018, but Houthi offensives shut them again.

From 2022 onward, oil became a direct weapon.  After the IRG retook Marib’s Safer field in 2020, the Houthis launched drone/missile attacks on the export terminal at Belhaf and other tankers .  The net effect: oil exports were halted.  The IMF notes that “after the Houthis’ attacks on oil facilities halted oil exports in 2022, Yemen became an oil importer” .  The complete loss of hydrocarbon revenue forced the IRG to adopt harsh fiscal and import controls and lean entirely on grants.

The blockade’s damage is massive: Hadramawt and Shabwah are under IRG control, and Marib (gas) is IRG-held, yet the Euphrates Oil Company (Tawke field) and pipelines could not be rehabilitated amid insecurity.  Protests in IRG areas (e.g. Mukalla mid-2025) have focused on blackouts and fuel shortages .  The IRG’s internal quarrels and lack of maintenance led to repeated fuel tanker scarcities.  Insight: Control of oil fields and export routes has become as strategic as any frontline.  The Houthis’ successful embargo has kept the IRG weak; the IRG’s inability to export has often undermined it in diplomatic talks  .

At the same time, local economic grievances surfaced.  Southern militias (UAE-aligned or STC) have fought over pipeline revenue.  Tribal blockades (e.g. by Sabban tribe in Marib) intermittently shut fields to extract concessions.  Informal exports (smuggled overland or via neighboring ports) fill some gaps but undermine tax bases.

In sum, Yemen’s oil economy remains a militarized resource.  Without secure exports or a unified fiscal management, neither side can fully exploit these assets.  Analysts emphasize that for any real stabilization, hydrocarbon revenues must resume in a transparent and equitable fashion  .

5. International Aid and Its Manipulation

Humanitarian and development aid have been both lifelines and geostrategic tools.  Aid flows ballooned after 2015 — peaking at over $10 billion/year for relief — but never matched needs.  The UN’s Yemen Response Plan remains chronically underfunded (less than 50% in 2024).  Major donors include the US, EU, UN agencies, GCC, and the World Bank.  Some aid (food rations, cash-for-work) is calibrated to stabilize food prices and incomes; other flows (development loans) aim to shore up governance.

However, currency policies greatly affected aid efficacy.  Early on, aid agencies paid beneficiaries in local currency at the “official” rate (YR250/$), which by 2016 grossly overvalued aid.  This inadvertently created arbitrage: smugglers would convert these funds on the black market.  It was only after CBY‑Aden floated the rial in 2017 that agencies like UNICEF and UNDP agreed to exchange a World Bank grant at market rates , reducing unintended enrichment.  By contrast, the Houthis insisted on official rates in the north, so northern beneficiaries saw little real gains even as inflation surged elsewhere.

The IMF and international financial institutions have also played a role.  Yemen rejoined IMF programs in 2021 with an SDR allocation (~$665m) , but deploying these funds faced governance hurdles.  A 2021 Sana’a Center analysis urged transparent SDR management (via an emergency monetary committee) .  The IMF’s Oct 2025 mission credits such steps: in mid-2025 the IRG created a National Committee for Regulating Imports, tightened import approvals, and restricted FX usage — measures that helped stabilize the rial and cut inflation .

Donors have at times played politics.  Gulf grants have been channeled irregularly (e.g. to finance military allies); Western donors have insisted on anti-corruption vetting (stalling budget support).  Sanctions on Houthi financial actors have pushed some aid through Aden’s banks.  The World Bank’s $400m social fund and cash-transfer programs were partly floated via Aden exchange networks as currency crises raged.  The WFP repeatedly warned (in 2022–25) that aid cuts could push millions past the hunger threshold, given these monetary instabilities.

In summary, aid has been necessary but insufficient.  Both sides view it as zero-sum: the Houthis seek to capture international legitimacy by running parallel aid systems in the north, while the IRG leverages aid into political capital (e.g. UN pledges to restore salaries).  Aid has not resolved fiscal gaps — for example, even after Saudi injection of ~$1.2 b in Aug 2023, the IRG’s deficit remained acute  — but has temporarily filled critical needs.

6. Food, Fuel and Inflation Economics

Yemen imports ~90% of its food and fuel.  Thus currency swings and logistics bottlenecks translate directly into human suffering.  Early in the war, food baskets in Aden more than quadrupled in price (400–700% inflation) as the rial crashed .  By contrast, Houthi areas initially saw smaller official price rises (their fixed rate masked underlying shortage), though black-market prices soared.  Over the decade, Yemen’s inflation has been among the world’s highest.  As IMF notes, consumer inflation hit ~27% in 2024 and peaked above 35% by July 2025 .  Food aid deliveries and local subsidies have been essential to avert starvation, but funding gaps (e.g. a $1.66 b WFP shortfall in 2023) required cutting rations for millions.

Fuel is especially politicized.  From 2015–2020, fuel subsidies in IRG areas helped dampen shock.  When the government cut subsidies (2023–2025), diesel and petrol pump prices jumped accordingly.  In Aug 2025, public fuel prices in Aden fell ~22–28% month-on-month after subsidy adjustments (per humanitarian bulletins ).  In Houthi territory, fuel has remained cheaper (at official pre-war prices) but is scarce; many northern generators run on smuggled diesel from Saudi Arabia.  Socotra Island (UAE-controlled) saw the most egregious fuel crisis: as noted, a UAE-linked distributor raised gasoline prices dramatically, sparking protests  .  Socotrans allege that ADNOC and other firms impose a “monopoly” on petrol and gas, subjecting residents to “systematic starvation” via overpriced fuel  .  These supply shocks feed straight into inflation – a double‑digit CPI rate for food and energy is typical.  For example, mid-2025 currency stabilization in Aden cut the monthly cost of the minimum food basket by ~34% .

The interplay is vicious: a weaker rial means higher import bills, which in turn fuels budget deficits when oil is absent.  Households cope by reducing consumption (malnutrition rose), substituting qat for food, or borrowing.  In early 2025, anti‑inflation measures (currency reforms, Saudi fuel shipments) finally arrested the rial’s slide , but prices remain far above pre-war levels.

7. Institutional Collapse and Corruption Patterns

Widespread institutional breakdown has pervaded every sector.  Central ministries are duplicated or empty; tax collection is split.  Notably, the national budget essentially disappeared: since 2019 no comprehensive budget has been approved, meaning expenditures (salaries, projects) rely on emergency decrees and donor requests .  Both administrations frequently failed to pay civil servants on time, generating protests (e.g. 2022 Aden riots).  Water and electricity utilities have collapsed, partly due to unpaid maintenance and fuel shortages (the Sana’a power plant sometimes sees only ~6 hours of fuel).

Corruption has been endemic.  The same monetary fragmentation that spawned “currency wars” also created rent-seeking opportunities.  For instance, in 2021 a UN panel accused the CBY‑Aden of funnelling oil‑export deposits to favored importers via overpriced exchanges  (though this allegation was later walked back, it reflected deep mistrust).  Commercial traders and military contractors have exploited customs split: some cargoes avoid official channels entirely, while militia checkpoints extract unofficial levies.  Gulf states have complained of Houthi corruption in northern areas (e.g. ethnic/tribal favoritism in allocations), but the IRG is no paragon: tribal intermediaries close to senior leaders take lucrative contracts, and large donors’ funds have at times been diverted or matched with subsidies to business cronies (even ahead of the 2018 currency float, critics alleged some exchange shops were owned by security officials ).

Within institutions, nepotism has soared.  New governors or ministers often fill public positions with loyalists without exams.  Some UAE training programs in the south created rival “security services” that have bleeding‑edge payrolls.  In this vacuum, informal networks have taken over: hawala brokers manage most remittances (estimated at 10–20% of GDP), and these networks have come under scrutiny for laundering Houthi funds or evading sanctions.

On the flip side, a few reform efforts emerged.  The IRG in late 2025 mandated that all public sector earnings be in rials and ended most dollar allowances (addressing illegal parallel payment practices ).  They also formed committees to audit fuel imports and military purchases.  However, with no functioning court system and dueling legal frameworks, enforcement is spotty.  The net effect is a quasi-feudal system: if you are allied to an armed faction, you thrive; if not, you survive as a humanitarian dependency.

8. Emerging and New Sectors

Traditional industry has largely shut down, but a few nascent sectors have gained a foothold amid chaos:
	•	Digital Finance and Microfinance:  With physical cash scarce in some areas, some electronic payment platforms (the CBY‑Sana’a’s e-Rial mobile wallets, and CBY‑Aden’s UNMoney) have tried to expand.  Take-up is limited: Yemenis’ distrust of banks (just 6% banking penetration) stalled early e‑salary pilots .  However, several microfinance banks (e.g. Al Kuraimi, Al-Amal) and mobile money firms operate across lines, enabling some small entrepreneurs and women-headed households to get loans or transfer funds.  These institutions found themselves in the crossfire of political battles – e.g. in mid-2024 the Aden CBY revoked licenses of six banks, including microfinance ones, to coerce relocation .  In effect, micro-lending persists but only on a tiny scale relative to needs.
	•	Remittances and Informal Trade:  The largest “new sector” is the Yemeni diaspora economy.  Remittances from Gulf-workers and others (10–20% of GDP pre-war) continue to flow via informal hawala networks.  These flows have largely stabilized consumption: often remittance receivers pay for imports themselves in dollars.  Additionally, a small class of Yemenis engages in entrepreneurial trade – exporting qat (a mild stimulant) to Somalia, or importing charcoal/fish.  Covid-19 and conflict curtailed but did not eliminate cross-border commerce.  Such informal commerce evades tariffs, so it’s hard to tax, but it underpins basic livelihoods.
	•	New Businesses:  A few local tech startups and mobile services have emerged (for instance, YemenMall in Aden sells goods online, Yemeni mobile apps collect donations), but in an environment of low trust and high insecurity, capital investment is scarce.  Utilities have seen attempts at PPPs (southern ports and power plants), but results are mixed.

Overall, the “new economy” in Yemen is muted.  Without rule of law or large-scale capital, innovation is ad hoc.  Some UN and NGO-run cash-for-work and short-term training programs provide microcredit support in camps, but these are band-aids.  The one bright spot is mobile connectivity: nearly all Yemenis have cell phones, and even the warlord zones (Houthi north, southern coalitions) allow phone networks.  Fintech experiments (mobile wallets, bio-ID cash transfers) have been piloted with mixed success.  These may lay a foundation for a more integrated financial infrastructure post-conflict.

Table 1. Actor-Event Matrix (illustrative):

Actor/Entity	Role/Influence	Key Economic Actions/Events
IRG / PLC & CBY-Aden	Southern government; retains IMF-recognition and donor backing.	Budget deficits; floated rial; formed import‑finance committee (2024); partly stabilized currency (2025) . Dependent on Saudi/UAE grants .
Ansar Allah (Houthis) / CBY-Sana’a	Controls north; uses parallel institutions.	Banned new banknotes (2020) ; introduced e‑Rial; taxes northern imports; blocked south’s oil exports (2022) ; limited liquidity by paying salaries partly in kind.
Saudi Arabia	Coalition leader, major financier of IRG.	Deployed military coalition; deposited $2b at CBY‑Aden (2018); brokered Riyadh Agreement (2019); provided ~$2b aid (2023–24) ; pressured IRG on reforms.
United Arab Emirates	Coalition partner, IRG donor, supporter of southern separatists.	Backed STC militias; secured Socotra (fuel imports); imposed high fuel prices via ADNOC (sparking protests)  ; built local security forces; partly funded IRG areas.
Southern Transitional Council	UAE-backed secessionist body in south.	Seized Aden (2019); co‑manages southern provinces; collects local revenue; occasionally clashes with IRG; lobbies for southern oil revenue share.
Iran	Political backer of Houthis.	Provides limited material support and strategy to Houthis; influence triggers US/Saudi caution (e.g. Houthi FTO label in 2021); but little direct economic aid.
IMF/World Bank/UN agencies	Providers of financial aid and policy advice.	IMF: SDR allocation (2021) ; advised on FX stabilization (NCRFI, 2025) . WB: ~$400m cash-for-work programs. WFP: forced to cut rations due to funding gaps.
Commercial Banks & Money Exchangers	Key intermediaries; some HQ in Sana’a, some in Aden.	Engaged in rate arbitrage (2017–2021) ; CBY-Aden shut many (2024) . Earned huge profits (one bank ~$80m in 2017). HQ relocations after U.S. sanctions (2021).
Tribal Networks (Marib, Shabwah)	Local power brokers in oil areas.	Periodically sabotage pipelines/oilfields to demand payments ; control smuggling routes; levy informal taxes on traders.
Humanitarian NGOs / INGOs	Deliver aid; use cash transfers.	Distribute food/CFW grants; pressured to use realistic FX rates. Suffer from inflation (aid buys less). Sometimes caught in politicized divisions (north/south programming).

(This matrix is schematic; many other actors – e.g. AQAP in south, tribal elders – play minor economic roles.)

10. Conclusion: Enduring Fragility

A decade of conflict has fundamentally reshaped Yemen’s political economy.  No single actor holds decisive economic power: the Houthis dominate revenue ports in the northwest, the IRG manages Gulf funds and western recognition, and Gulf donors pull all strings.  Despite periodic reforms and international interventions, Yemen’s financial system remains on life support.  Currency stabilization in 2024–25, underpinned by Saudi support and CBY reforms, offers a small reprieve; yet a full recovery is impossible without political settlement.  In the meantime, Yemenis face continuing hardship: inflation, unemployment, and aid dependency have surged.

This analysis underscores that Yemen’s war is as much over banks and gas fields as it is over territory.  Any lasting solution must address the deep economic fragmentation: reunifying the central bank, reintegrating oil revenues, and building transparent fiscal institutions.  Policymakers should note that unilateral economic measures (blockades, money printing, bans) have so far backfired, deepening mistrust and fragility.  As the IMF report (Oct 2025) advises, sustainable recovery will require “strictly limited monetary financing, transparent budgeting, and revitalized export sectors”  .  The path forward is narrow: a deescalation of economic warfare coupled with targeted international support (grants for critical imports, incentives for confidence-building measures) is needed to prevent further collapse.

Yemen’s Financial and Economic Trajectory (2015–2025)

Figure: Infographic depiction of Yemen’s conflict zones and actors (Houthis vs. government/coalition) and its economic impact (source: Al Jazeera) – the duality of control laid the groundwork for today’s split financial system.

Between 2015 and 2025 Yemen’s economy has been upended by civil war, institutional fragmentation, and external pressures.  The collapse of unified state authority left two parallel financial systems: the Houthi‑led authorities (in Sana’a and the north) and the internationally‑recognized government (IRG, now led by the Riyadh‑backed Presidential Leadership Council) in the south.  Each side established its own central bank, currency and fiscal strategy.  What began as a conventional conflict quickly morphed into an economic war: oil exports were seized or blockaded, customs and taxes were contested, and each camp weaponized monetary and fiscal policy.  By late 2025, Yemen’s GDP had shrunk by roughly half, inflation exceeded 35% in IRG areas, and public revenues had collapsed  .  Donor aid and remittances became the lifeline of both zones, but funding shortfalls and politicized distribution left millions impoverished.

The following report presents a chronological analysis (2015–2025) overlaid with strategic insights, and maps the evolving financial institutions, currency regimes, fiscal dynamics, and the roles of all major actors.  It also offers thematic deep dives into key issues: the currency “war” and dual banking system; hydrocarbons economics; aid flows; food/fuel inflation; institutional collapse and corruption; and emerging sectors (e.g. digital finance, microfinance).  Throughout, evidence-based citations are provided (see endnotes).  The tone is factual, multidisciplinary, and policy‑oriented.

1. Chronology of Economic and Financial Developments (2015–2025)
	•	2015 (War and Blockade): In March 2015 a Saudi‑led coalition intervened to restore President Hadi, reversing the Houthis’ seizure of Sana’a.  Civil conflict and a naval blockade instantly gutted Yemen’s economy.  Oil and gas production halted, imports ground to a standstill, and the Central Bank of Yemen (CBY) lost access to reserves  .  Public sector salaries and subsidies stopped; by late 2015 basic commodity prices had exploded (cumulative inflation spiking over 100%) and acute hunger spread.  International agencies warned of famine.  Insight: The loss of a unified central bank early on meant Yemen had no institution to stabilize prices or manage shortages . Instead, both sides began weaponizing the currency from the outset.
	•	2016 (Central Bank Split, Currency Crash): In September 2016 President Hadi ordered the CBY’s headquarters moved from Sana’a to Aden, formalizing a bifurcation of monetary control .  The Sana’a branch remained in the north (Houthi zones), and the Aden branch (internationally recognized) was left with few reserves or staff.  The rial immediately began tumbling.  By early 2017 the official peg of YR250/$ had broken, and in Aden one US$ cost ~YR370 on the black market  .  Humanitarian aid agencies, forced to use market rates, inadvertently fueled arbitrage (exchanging UN dollars at black‑market rates).  The CBY‑Aden began printing money against a Saudi deposit to pay salaries, but without foreign exchange to back it, this only accelerated inflation  .  Insight: The 2016 split of the CBY created two rival banks incapable of mutual stabilization .  Without coordination, the currency crash in government areas fueled famine and unrest (e.g. Aden protests in 2018), while the Houthis maintained a more stable rial by holding onto older notes and leveraging northwestern ports for forex.
	•	2017–2018 (Currency Arbitrage and Devaluation): Facing a surging parallel rate (YR800–1000/$ by 2018), the IRG floated the rial in August 2017 .  The Sana’a government refused to float its rates, keeping customs and tariffs at YR250/$ while Aden markets moved.  This currency arbitrage enriched money‑exchange operators and eroded humanitarian purchasing power.  International pressure (from the UN, World Bank and donors) finally convinced CBY‑Aden to abandon its peg  .  By late 2018, a Saudi $2 billion deposit had briefly staved off a crash: the rial recovered to ~YR340/$ after peaking near YR1750 .  But the funds were mostly exhausted by 2020.  Insight: This period saw the rial become a politicized commodity.  The World Bank and IMF began talking to Yemen, and donors experimented with “dual exchange rates” (offering a special rate for aid distribution).  Yet no stable framework emerged: rival authorities were locked in a game of one‑upmanship on currency policy  .
	•	2019–2020 (Formal Currency War and E-Rial): In Dec 2019 the Houthi authorities in Sana’a banned all new “Aden‑printed” banknotes, declaring them invalid in the north .  They also introduced a digital “e-Rial” (through select telecom-backed accounts) and later minted Houthi coins.  This cemented a two‑currency reality.  Consequently, Aden‑area rials plummeted into hyperinflation (trading ~YR642/$ by Jan 2020) while the old rial in Houthi areas remained around YR590/$  .  Citizens in the south hoarded ever‑new rials, driving food‐baskets costs up 400–700%.  Simultaneously, the IRG’s Aden bank struggled with corruption scandals (a UN panel alleged its officials misused Saudi deposits ) and dwindling reserves.  By early 2020 Yemen had effectively been partitioned financially.  Insight: The 2020 banknote ban was a turning point: it institutionalized the currency schism and foreshadowed Yemen’s permanent economic split  .  It also forced humanitarian actors to adapt (some began valuing aid at the market rather than “official” rate, after realizing fixed-rate vouchers were exploited for arbitrage).
	•	2020–2021 (Fiscal Collapse and Fragmentation): The IRG, now under a new Presidential Leadership Council (PLC) from 2022, effectively ran out of revenue.  Oil and gas revenues had been halted by conflict (and later by Houthi attacks).  Customs and tax collection fractured: in 2020 the Houthis seized the central port of Hudaydah (and taxed imports there), even as the south’s government lost customs revenue to competing southern ports.  Public budgets collapsed (no full national budget has been passed since 2019 ), and the government depended on irregular Saudi/UAE grants ($1–2 billion/year in sporadic tranches ).  Unpaid salaries spurred protests in Aden and Mukalla.  In Apr 2022 the Houthis scaled up economic warfare: they blockaded the IRG’s oil export terminals with drones/missiles .  A short UN truce (Apr–Oct 2022) included talk of reopening roads and paying wages, but collapsed.  The Houthis then resumed their naval campaign (attacking Red Sea shipping) and tightened the economic vice: they banned government‑issued fuel, imposed customs fees on overland trade, and plowed checkpoints on trade routes  .  Insight: By 2022 the conflict had “migrated to the economy” – controlling customs, ports and oil fields became as important as holding cities  .  The IRG was starved of forex, becoming an oil importer, while Houthis amassed war revenues from the north.
	•	2023 (Banking Struggle and Resurgent Rial): In 2023–2024 the Aden‑based CBY took bold steps to reclaim control.  It consolidated money transfer networks under a Unified Money Transfer Network (UNMoney) from early 2024  , and in July revoked the licenses of six major Sana’a-headquartered banks (including commercial and microfinance banks) that had not relocated to Aden .  This aimed to force all banking via Aden and international lines.  The Houthis retaliated by closing branches and blocking transfers.  In response to rampant speculation, in mid‑2024 the PLC government instituted new exchange controls and an import‑financing committee.  By late 2024, with renewed Saudi grants and tightened FX controls, the rial in government areas had appreciated by ~40%, easing inflation .  (The IMF noted that inflation peaked at ~35% in mid‑2025 as the rial weakened, then subsided after August reforms .)  Houthi areas, in contrast, continued to use old rials at a roughly fixed official parity.
	•	2025 (Stabilization and Stalemate): In 2025 the currency tug‑of‑war remained intense.  The PLC’s reforms – relocating banks to Aden, centralizing FX trading, and inviting new Saudis deposits – finally stabilized the southern rial (trading ~YR1,600–1,800/$ by Nov 2025  ).  South Yemen cut fuel subsidies (further realigning prices with market rates) and announced a $1.2 billion Saudi aid package in Aug 2023 (part disbursed 2024–25).  These moves cut food‑basket inflation roughly in half in government areas by mid‑2025.  However, in Houthi regions prices fell little (the old rial’s value was still fixed).  Meanwhile, Yemen’s war economy shifted again: in Sept 2025 amid regional rapprochements the U.S. halted Houthi sanctions, forcing some cooperation talks.  But as of Nov 2025 Yemen remains divided: the Houthis control Sana’a and much of the northwest, the IRG controls Aden/Marib and the oil/gas fields, and neither side can project power enough to end the stalemate.

The timeline above is a high‑level sketch.  Figure 1 (below) and Table 1 (right) summarize this chronologically and by actors (see pages at end).  Key inflection points include: the CBY split (Sept 2016), the Houthi currency ban (Dec 2019), the blockade of oil (2022), and the UN‑brokered currency escalations (2024–25).  Each of these events entwined conflict dynamics with economic policy in novel ways.

2. Actors and Stakeholders

Yemen’s economic reality reflects a tapestry of domestic and international actors, each pursuing strategic interests through financial means.  Below are the principal players and their roles (these underlie Figure 2 actor-event map).
	•	Internationally Recognized Government (IRG) / Presidential Leadership Council (PLC) – Based in Aden (until 2022 under President Hadi, now an 8‑member PLC backed by Saudi/UAE).  Seeks to maintain legitimacy over “southern” Yemen.  Controls the Aden‑based CBY which, despite lacking reserves, issues the rial and runs fiscal policy (often printing money to pay salaries).  Heavily dependent on Saudi/UAE grants ($1–2 b/year) to cover budgets  .  It lost control of northern economic hubs and had to cede many institutions; now focuses on stabilizing the currency and finance via external support.  Its economic strategy (under the PLC) has included forming national committees for imports and FX, encouraging bank relocations to Aden, and attempting to reactivate oil exports (through UAE-mediated deals).  Internal divisions (e.g. between traditional Islah-affiliated units vs. secessionist STC groups) have weakened cohesion.  Cited: IMF, Sana’a Center, Sana’a.
	•	Ansar Allah (Houthis) and Sana’a Central Bank – Zaidi Shia militia turned de facto government in Sanaa (allied with ex-Saleh GPC elements).  They control the northwestern highlands and institutions.  The Houthi-controlled CBY in Sana’a declared Aden notes invalid (Dec 2019) and later issued its own digital (e‑Rial) and coin currency .  It floats little cash, preferring barter and existing rials, which kept official inflation “stable” but created chronic liquidity shortages.  The Houthis have taxed imports at Hudaydah/Salif, siphoned oil/gas revenues (from Ma’rib/Shabwah pipelines), and targeted IRG oil terminals (2022–2023)  .  They also leveraged port revenues (Hodeidah taxes, telecom monopolies) to fund governance and military spending.  Economically, they have run parallel budgets and used Gulf aid selectively (some UN food aid resumed by July 2024 after blockade).  Cited: Reuters, Sana’a Center, IMF.
	•	Saudi Arabia – Leads the 2015 coalition backing the IRG.  Seeks a weak friendly Yemen, blocking Iranian influence.  Saudi Arabia has provided the bulk of foreign aid to the government (billions in grants and oil deposits) and pressured the PLC on reforms.  It initially insisted on fiscal orthodoxy (e.g. via a “Roadmap” agreement), at times curbing CBY‑Aden’s currency interventions.  Saudi penalties (e.g. freezing oil revenues at Mukalla’s pipeline, which instead went to a Saudi bank) have been used to discipline finance.  Riyadh also mediated intra-IRG conflicts, funded military operations, and engaged in oil diplomacy (such as the Arab Monetary Fund support).  In 2023–2025 Saudi influence led to partial de‑escalations: e.g. UN envoy Grundberg’s July 2024 agreement (urging bilateral pause on banking hostilities) was driven by Riyadh .  Saudi Belt projects (roads, security) and clandestine cash infusions have kept IRG afloat.  Cited: Reuters, Sana’a Center, IMF.
	•	United Arab Emirates (UAE) – Coalition partner, but increasingly a separate power center.  Backed the Southern Transitional Council (STC) and local militias (Giants Brigades, Hadrami, Abyan forces) aiming to carve out a southern state.  Officially withdrew ground forces by 2019, but militarily and economically entrenched in Socotra Island and parts of Abyan/Shabwah.  UAE-linked firms (e.g. ADNOC) control Socotra’s fuel market, sparking protests over exorbitant prices  .  The UAE has also paid salaries and pensions in liberated areas, invested in ports (Aden, Mokha), and facilitated export deals (e.g. for IRG oil via third countries).  In practice, Abu Dhabi’s role has been double-edged: it has sustained southern governance (and splintered Hadi’s authority), but also earned distrust by economic domination of southern provinces.  Cited: Yemen Press Agency, Al-Thawra, Sana’a Center.
	•	Southern Transitional Council (STC) – A UAE‑backed secessionist body led by Aiderous al-Zubaidi.  Controls Aden (2019 coup) and other southern provinces with its own militias.  While formally aligned with the IRG in coalition battles, the STC often undermines Aden’s authority and collects taxes locally.  It maintains parallel security forces and has even negotiated separate fuel imports for Socotra under UAE auspices.  The STC’s economic agenda is essentially separatist autonomy: it seeks a share of oil revenues (e.g. insisting on local control of Hadramawt’s exports) and UAE support for southern salaries.  Cited: [Contextual from report of Riyadh Agreement, Sana’a Center notes]*.
	•	Iran – Regional patron of the Houthis.  Although not a direct financial backer at scale, Iran is believed to provide limited military aid and strategic guidance.  Iranian influence is widely cited in the conflict narrative (and the Saudis/Riyadh peace envoy have engaged Tehran indirectly).  However, its economic role is minor compared to Gulf money.  It serves more as a geopolitical factor, prompting U.S./Saudi caution (e.g. the earlier Houthi FTO designation, later lifted in 2021) than as a source of Yemeni liquidity.  Cited: ACLED, media (Houthis linked to Iran support).
	•	IMF, World Bank, UN Agencies and Donors (US, EU, Gulf, INGOs) – These international players have injected thousands of millions into Yemen since 2015 (humanitarian + limited development aid).  The IMF allocated SDR $665m in Aug 2021 (COVID response), which could yield ~$665m hard currency .  World Bank and Arab Funds also gave grants (e.g. a $400m cash-for-work loan, Arab Monetary Fund aid).  Donors have largely channeled funds through NGOs and the CBY‑Aden.  They insisted on reform (pressuring the rial to float in 2017 ) and on accountability (World Bank funded new electronic wage systems).  However, uneven access (northern NGOs kept to fixed-rates) meant some funds fueled arbitrage.  Aid agencies like the WFP warned repeatedly of cuts due to underfunding.  In 2023 the WFP reduced rations after a $1.66 b funding gap.  Donors remain crucial (e.g. pledges of billions at UN conferences in 2024–25), but also instrumentalize aid: funds often target specific governorates or political constituencies.  Cited: Sana’a Center, IMF, WFP statements.
	•	Central Bank of Yemen (Aden branch) – Legally the national central bank, recognized by the IMF/Gulf community.  Managed by government appointees, its governor (since 2021) was tasked with unifying monetary policy.  CBY‑Aden controlled currency issuance (new rials since 2016), foreign reserves (Saudi deposit of $2b, IMF swaps, aid-funded forex), and attempted currency stabilization.  Weaknesses: a massive staff split (most archives/staff in Sana’a) and scant reserves.  It faced repeated accusations of favoritism (a UN panel alleged misuse of Riyadh’s deposit for selective importers ), which it denies.  Key actions: floating the rial (2017), auctioning FX for imports (2021), establishing UNMoney network (2024), and from Aug 2025 raising reserves and sterilizing money supply (with Saudi-funded FX sales)  .  Cited: Sana’a Center analysis, IMF.
	•	Central Bank of Yemen (Sana’a branch) – Houthi-controlled.  It prints older-series rials (as of 2016) and sets some internal tariffs.  It has no foreign reserves (all reserves were moved to Aden) and is not IMF‑recognized.  In practice it mainly clears government transactions and has experimented with digital credits (e-Rial).  Its foreign policy (e.g. routing humanitarian dollars via Iran or third-country banks) is constrained.  A major move was the 2024 proposal to denominate some transfers in Saudi riyals  to preserve liquidity.  But the Sana’a CBY cannot control exchange rates in Aden or foreign trade.  Cited: Sana’a Center reports.
	•	Commercial Banks, Exchange Houses and Hawala Networks – The money changers have been major actors: during the 2017–2021 collapse they profited from dual rates, often operating across zones.  Several large banks (Tadhamon, Kuraimi, Shamil Bank, etc.) had branches in both north and south.  The IRS of 2024 shows how enmeshment with political factions allowed illicit speculation.  For example, in mid-2021 the CBY-Aden closed 50 exchangers and inspected banks to curb speculation .  Sanctions (e.g. on Houthi financial backers) and Aden’s threats (2024 bank license revocations ) forced many banks to shift operations south.  Microfinance institutions (Al-Amal, Al-Kuraimi) also got drawn in, highlighting how even “innovative” sectors were caught in the conflict.  Cited: Sana’a Center (July–Sept 2024), Sana’a Center (July 2021).
	•	Tribal and Local Power Brokers – In Yemen’s periphery, tribal sheikhs and local militias control many roads and trade.  In petroleum areas (Marib, Shabwah, Hadramawt) tribes have historically blown pipelines to demand local revenue shares .  During the war they have been armed clients of either side (often shifting allegiances).  Tribes also operate informal smuggling networks (fuel, qat, weapons) that move goods bypassing customs, undermining both sides’ revenues.  While hard to map, these networks are essential for remittances to reach rural families.  Tribal taxation (e.g. on migrants or fuel convoys) provides an unofficial revenue stream for some local authorities.  Cited: ACW analysis, news (e.g. pipeline bombings).
	•	Other Foreign Actors – The US, UK and EU have mostly provided targeted aid and sanctions.  The US’s 2021 reversal of the Houthi FTO label (and its 2022 designation of them as terror-supporting) directly affected banks: Houthi-area banks moved some functions to Aden to avoid US sanctions .  Oman has quietly facilitated negotiations and allowed limited flights.  Gulf rivals (Qatar, Kuwait) engaged through UN diplomacy.  The “Arab Coalition” countries (Saudi/UAE) have been the dominant regional players.  Cited: ACLED, Sana’a Center.

This complex cast turns Yemen’s economy into a matrix of competition.  Figure 2 (below) sketches how each actor intersects with events – for example, the Houthis weaponize customs, while Saudi/the IRG lean on fuel subsidies and bank enforcement; donors and the UN shuttle between facilitating aid and demanding monetary discipline; UAE-enabled businesses dominate southern fuel markets, etc.

3. The Currency “War” and Dual Banking System

Yemen’s currency saga is at the heart of its economic crisis.  As noted, two central banks and two rials have functioned since 2016  .  The Government of Yemen (CBY‑Aden) has printed “new rials” (2017–2025 series) to finance budgets, abandoning fixed pegs and eventually floating the currency.  The Sana’a authorities continue to circulate only pre‑2016 banknotes (and some newly minted coins) and have maintained a separate rate policy.  These overlapping regimes have driven persistent inflation disparities: by mid-2025, the Aden rial was ~YR1,630/US$1  (a stabilization from YR2,600+ earlier), whereas the Houthi‑area currency remained pegged (officially ~YR600 before 2022, though black‐market implied rates exceeded YR1,200).  In effect, two parallel exchange rates prevail – one for government-held markets and a pseudo-fixed rate in the north.

This “currency war” has several consequences.  Arbitrage thrives: money‑changers buy cheap notes in Houthi areas (by unofficial means) and sell in the government zones.  During crises, Yemeni exporters (or aid agencies) have shopped for the highest-dollar bids, draining reserves.  Inflation has been especially brutal in the Aden sphere.  For example, in late 2021 the rial collapsed to YR2,900/$ (its worst value since 2016) amid massive speculative attacks .  CBY‑Aden’s 2021 intervention (raiding exchange shops) and a shift of some USD remittances into formal banks helped it recover by year-end  .  Similarly, in Aug 2025 a new policy council (with the PLG) devalued the rial and used Saudi deposits to rebuild reserves , which slashed food inflation in Aden by ~50%.

In contrast, the Houthi-controlled zones saw limited formal inflation (state‐fixed prices) but rampant black‑market hikes.  The Houthis’ decision to reject new rials (Jan 2020) was justified as anti‑inflationary, yet it isolated their liquidity.  When CBY‑Aden floated its currency, north-south trade suffered: households in Sana’a had only old, tattered notes and paid a premium to buy Aden’s new bills .  By Jan 2020 official exchange data showed divergent rates (YR655 in Aden vs YR590 in Sana’a) .  Everyday Yemenis in Houthi areas began hoarding dollars and Saudi riyals, fearing a general crash.

Attempts at monetary innovation have largely failed.  The Sana’a CBY’s e‑Rial pilots (2018–2019) and April 2020 food-voucher programs collapsed due to Yemen’s cash-based economy: only ~6% of adults have bank accounts .  Similarly, CBY‑Aden’s 2024 Unified Money Network (UNMoney) sought to centralize e-payments, but the Sana’a authorities threatened banks that use it .  Ultimately, neither side has achieved currency unity.  As an IMF review notes, after years of printing, the IRG’s money supply far outstripped credible revenues, leaving real riyal purchasing power at historic lows .  Only a political settlement could truly reunify Yemen’s currency – an outcome still distant.

4. Oil and Hydrocarbon Economics

Oil and gas were Yemen’s pre-eminent revenue source (about 70–80% of GDP and exports ), concentrated in Hadramawt, Marib and Shabwah.  Before 2015, Yemen exported ~120,000 barrels/day of crude (primarily from Masila/Marib fields) and LNG via a pipeline to Aden.  Since war erupted, hydrocarbon output collapsed.  Key export terminals fell to the Houthis (Hudaydah) or were blockaded; pipelines were repeatedly bombed by insurgent tribes and rebels .  By late 2015 Yemen was functionally an importer of oil.  A brief revival occurred when the IRG reopened Marib’s gas fields in 2018, but Houthi offensives shut them again.

From 2022 onward, oil became a direct weapon.  After the IRG retook Marib’s Safer field in 2020, the Houthis launched drone/missile attacks on the export terminal at Belhaf and other tankers .  The net effect: oil exports were halted.  The IMF notes that “after the Houthis’ attacks on oil facilities halted oil exports in 2022, Yemen became an oil importer” .  The complete loss of hydrocarbon revenue forced the IRG to adopt harsh fiscal and import controls and lean entirely on grants.

The blockade’s damage is massive: Hadramawt and Shabwah are under IRG control, and Marib (gas) is IRG-held, yet the Euphrates Oil Company (Tawke field) and pipelines could not be rehabilitated amid insecurity.  Protests in IRG areas (e.g. Mukalla mid-2025) have focused on blackouts and fuel shortages .  The IRG’s internal quarrels and lack of maintenance led to repeated fuel tanker scarcities.  Insight: Control of oil fields and export routes has become as strategic as any frontline.  The Houthis’ successful embargo has kept the IRG weak; the IRG’s inability to export has often undermined it in diplomatic talks  .

At the same time, local economic grievances surfaced.  Southern militias (UAE-aligned or STC) have fought over pipeline revenue.  Tribal blockades (e.g. by Sabban tribe in Marib) intermittently shut fields to extract concessions.  Informal exports (smuggled overland or via neighboring ports) fill some gaps but undermine tax bases.

In sum, Yemen’s oil economy remains a militarized resource.  Without secure exports or a unified fiscal management, neither side can fully exploit these assets.  Analysts emphasize that for any real stabilization, hydrocarbon revenues must resume in a transparent and equitable fashion  .

5. International Aid and Its Manipulation

Humanitarian and development aid have been both lifelines and geostrategic tools.  Aid flows ballooned after 2015 — peaking at over $10 billion/year for relief — but never matched needs.  The UN’s Yemen Response Plan remains chronically underfunded (less than 50% in 2024).  Major donors include the US, EU, UN agencies, GCC, and the World Bank.  Some aid (food rations, cash-for-work) is calibrated to stabilize food prices and incomes; other flows (development loans) aim to shore up governance.

However, currency policies greatly affected aid efficacy.  Early on, aid agencies paid beneficiaries in local currency at the “official” rate (YR250/$), which by 2016 grossly overvalued aid.  This inadvertently created arbitrage: smugglers would convert these funds on the black market.  It was only after CBY‑Aden floated the rial in 2017 that agencies like UNICEF and UNDP agreed to exchange a World Bank grant at market rates , reducing unintended enrichment.  By contrast, the Houthis insisted on official rates in the north, so northern beneficiaries saw little real gains even as inflation surged elsewhere.

The IMF and international financial institutions have also played a role.  Yemen rejoined IMF programs in 2021 with an SDR allocation (~$665m) , but deploying these funds faced governance hurdles.  A 2021 Sana’a Center analysis urged transparent SDR management (via an emergency monetary committee) .  The IMF’s Oct 2025 mission credits such steps: in mid-2025 the IRG created a National Committee for Regulating Imports, tightened import approvals, and restricted FX usage — measures that helped stabilize the rial and cut inflation .

Donors have at times played politics.  Gulf grants have been channeled irregularly (e.g. to finance military allies); Western donors have insisted on anti-corruption vetting (stalling budget support).  Sanctions on Houthi financial actors have pushed some aid through Aden’s banks.  The World Bank’s $400m social fund and cash-transfer programs were partly floated via Aden exchange networks as currency crises raged.  The WFP repeatedly warned (in 2022–25) that aid cuts could push millions past the hunger threshold, given these monetary instabilities.

In summary, aid has been necessary but insufficient.  Both sides view it as zero-sum: the Houthis seek to capture international legitimacy by running parallel aid systems in the north, while the IRG leverages aid into political capital (e.g. UN pledges to restore salaries).  Aid has not resolved fiscal gaps — for example, even after Saudi injection of ~$1.2 b in Aug 2023, the IRG’s deficit remained acute  — but has temporarily filled critical needs.

6. Food, Fuel and Inflation Economics

Yemen imports ~90% of its food and fuel.  Thus currency swings and logistics bottlenecks translate directly into human suffering.  Early in the war, food baskets in Aden more than quadrupled in price (400–700% inflation) as the rial crashed .  By contrast, Houthi areas initially saw smaller official price rises (their fixed rate masked underlying shortage), though black-market prices soared.  Over the decade, Yemen’s inflation has been among the world’s highest.  As IMF notes, consumer inflation hit ~27% in 2024 and peaked above 35% by July 2025 .  Food aid deliveries and local subsidies have been essential to avert starvation, but funding gaps (e.g. a $1.66 b WFP shortfall in 2023) required cutting rations for millions.

Fuel is especially politicized.  From 2015–2020, fuel subsidies in IRG areas helped dampen shock.  When the government cut subsidies (2023–2025), diesel and petrol pump prices jumped accordingly.  In Aug 2025, public fuel prices in Aden fell ~22–28% month-on-month after subsidy adjustments (per humanitarian bulletins ).  In Houthi territory, fuel has remained cheaper (at official pre-war prices) but is scarce; many northern generators run on smuggled diesel from Saudi Arabia.  Socotra Island (UAE-controlled) saw the most egregious fuel crisis: as noted, a UAE-linked distributor raised gasoline prices dramatically, sparking protests  .  Socotrans allege that ADNOC and other firms impose a “monopoly” on petrol and gas, subjecting residents to “systematic starvation” via overpriced fuel  .  These supply shocks feed straight into inflation – a double‑digit CPI rate for food and energy is typical.  For example, mid-2025 currency stabilization in Aden cut the monthly cost of the minimum food basket by ~34% .

The interplay is vicious: a weaker rial means higher import bills, which in turn fuels budget deficits when oil is absent.  Households cope by reducing consumption (malnutrition rose), substituting qat for food, or borrowing.  In early 2025, anti‑inflation measures (currency reforms, Saudi fuel shipments) finally arrested the rial’s slide , but prices remain far above pre-war levels.

7. Institutional Collapse and Corruption Patterns

Widespread institutional breakdown has pervaded every sector.  Central ministries are duplicated or empty; tax collection is split.  Notably, the national budget essentially disappeared: since 2019 no comprehensive budget has been approved, meaning expenditures (salaries, projects) rely on emergency decrees and donor requests .  Both administrations frequently failed to pay civil servants on time, generating protests (e.g. 2022 Aden riots).  Water and electricity utilities have collapsed, partly due to unpaid maintenance and fuel shortages (the Sana’a power plant sometimes sees only ~6 hours of fuel).

Corruption has been endemic.  The same monetary fragmentation that spawned “currency wars” also created rent-seeking opportunities.  For instance, in 2021 a UN panel accused the CBY‑Aden of funnelling oil‑export deposits to favored importers via overpriced exchanges  (though this allegation was later walked back, it reflected deep mistrust).  Commercial traders and military contractors have exploited customs split: some cargoes avoid official channels entirely, while militia checkpoints extract unofficial levies.  Gulf states have complained of Houthi corruption in northern areas (e.g. ethnic/tribal favoritism in allocations), but the IRG is no paragon: tribal intermediaries close to senior leaders take lucrative contracts, and large donors’ funds have at times been diverted or matched with subsidies to business cronies (even ahead of the 2018 currency float, critics alleged some exchange shops were owned by security officials ).

Within institutions, nepotism has soared.  New governors or ministers often fill public positions with loyalists without exams.  Some UAE training programs in the south created rival “security services” that have bleeding‑edge payrolls.  In this vacuum, informal networks have taken over: hawala brokers manage most remittances (estimated at 10–20% of GDP), and these networks have come under scrutiny for laundering Houthi funds or evading sanctions.

On the flip side, a few reform efforts emerged.  The IRG in late 2025 mandated that all public sector earnings be in rials and ended most dollar allowances (addressing illegal parallel payment practices ).  They also formed committees to audit fuel imports and military purchases.  However, with no functioning court system and dueling legal frameworks, enforcement is spotty.  The net effect is a quasi-feudal system: if you are allied to an armed faction, you thrive; if not, you survive as a humanitarian dependency.

8. Emerging and New Sectors

Traditional industry has largely shut down, but a few nascent sectors have gained a foothold amid chaos:
	•	Digital Finance and Microfinance:  With physical cash scarce in some areas, some electronic payment platforms (the CBY‑Sana’a’s e-Rial mobile wallets, and CBY‑Aden’s UNMoney) have tried to expand.  Take-up is limited: Yemenis’ distrust of banks (just 6% banking penetration) stalled early e‑salary pilots .  However, several microfinance banks (e.g. Al Kuraimi, Al-Amal) and mobile money firms operate across lines, enabling some small entrepreneurs and women-headed households to get loans or transfer funds.  These institutions found themselves in the crossfire of political battles – e.g. in mid-2024 the Aden CBY revoked licenses of six banks, including microfinance ones, to coerce relocation .  In effect, micro-lending persists but only on a tiny scale relative to needs.
	•	Remittances and Informal Trade:  The largest “new sector” is the Yemeni diaspora economy.  Remittances from Gulf-workers and others (10–20% of GDP pre-war) continue to flow via informal hawala networks.  These flows have largely stabilized consumption: often remittance receivers pay for imports themselves in dollars.  Additionally, a small class of Yemenis engages in entrepreneurial trade – exporting qat (a mild stimulant) to Somalia, or importing charcoal/fish.  Covid-19 and conflict curtailed but did not eliminate cross-border commerce.  Such informal commerce evades tariffs, so it’s hard to tax, but it underpins basic livelihoods.
	•	New Businesses:  A few local tech startups and mobile services have emerged (for instance, YemenMall in Aden sells goods online, Yemeni mobile apps collect donations), but in an environment of low trust and high insecurity, capital investment is scarce.  Utilities have seen attempts at PPPs (southern ports and power plants), but results are mixed.

Overall, the “new economy” in Yemen is muted.  Without rule of law or large-scale capital, innovation is ad hoc.  Some UN and NGO-run cash-for-work and short-term training programs provide microcredit support in camps, but these are band-aids.  The one bright spot is mobile connectivity: nearly all Yemenis have cell phones, and even the warlord zones (Houthi north, southern coalitions) allow phone networks.  Fintech experiments (mobile wallets, bio-ID cash transfers) have been piloted with mixed success.  These may lay a foundation for a more integrated financial infrastructure post-conflict.

Table 1. Actor-Event Matrix (illustrative):

Actor/Entity	Role/Influence	Key Economic Actions/Events
IRG / PLC & CBY-Aden	Southern government; retains IMF-recognition and donor backing.	Budget deficits; floated rial; formed import‑finance committee (2024); partly stabilized currency (2025) . Dependent on Saudi/UAE grants .
Ansar Allah (Houthis) / CBY-Sana’a	Controls north; uses parallel institutions.	Banned new banknotes (2020) ; introduced e‑Rial; taxes northern imports; blocked south’s oil exports (2022) ; limited liquidity by paying salaries partly in kind.
Saudi Arabia	Coalition leader, major financier of IRG.	Deployed military coalition; deposited $2b at CBY‑Aden (2018); brokered Riyadh Agreement (2019); provided ~$2b aid (2023–24) ; pressured IRG on reforms.
United Arab Emirates	Coalition partner, IRG donor, supporter of southern separatists.	Backed STC militias; secured Socotra (fuel imports); imposed high fuel prices via ADNOC (sparking protests)  ; built local security forces; partly funded IRG areas.
Southern Transitional Council	UAE-backed secessionist body in south.	Seized Aden (2019); co‑manages southern provinces; collects local revenue; occasionally clashes with IRG; lobbies for southern oil revenue share.
Iran	Political backer of Houthis.	Provides limited material support and strategy to Houthis; influence triggers US/Saudi caution (e.g. Houthi FTO label in 2021); but little direct economic aid.
IMF/World Bank/UN agencies	Providers of financial aid and policy advice.	IMF: SDR allocation (2021) ; advised on FX stabilization (NCRFI, 2025) . WB: ~$400m cash-for-work programs. WFP: forced to cut rations due to funding gaps.
Commercial Banks & Money Exchangers	Key intermediaries; some HQ in Sana’a, some in Aden.	Engaged in rate arbitrage (2017–2021) ; CBY-Aden shut many (2024) . Earned huge profits (one bank ~$80m in 2017). HQ relocations after U.S. sanctions (2021).
Tribal Networks (Marib, Shabwah)	Local power brokers in oil areas.	Periodically sabotage pipelines/oilfields to demand payments ; control smuggling routes; levy informal taxes on traders.
Humanitarian NGOs / INGOs	Deliver aid; use cash transfers.	Distribute food/CFW grants; pressured to use realistic FX rates. Suffer from inflation (aid buys less). Sometimes caught in politicized divisions (north/south programming).

(This matrix is schematic; many other actors – e.g. AQAP in south, tribal elders – play minor economic roles.)

10. Conclusion: Enduring Fragility

A decade of conflict has fundamentally reshaped Yemen’s political economy.  No single actor holds decisive economic power: the Houthis dominate revenue ports in the northwest, the IRG manages Gulf funds and western recognition, and Gulf donors pull all strings.  Despite periodic reforms and international interventions, Yemen’s financial system remains on life support.  Currency stabilization in 2024–25, underpinned by Saudi support and CBY reforms, offers a small reprieve; yet a full recovery is impossible without political settlement.  In the meantime, Yemenis face continuing hardship: inflation, unemployment, and aid dependency have surged.

This analysis underscores that Yemen’s war is as much over banks and gas fields as it is over territory.  Any lasting solution must address the deep economic fragmentation: reunifying the central bank, reintegrating oil revenues, and building transparent fiscal institutions.  Policymakers should note that unilateral economic measures (blockades, money printing, bans) have so far backfired, deepening mistrust and fragility.  As the IMF report (Oct 2025) advises, sustainable recovery will require “strictly limited monetary financing, transparent budgeting, and revitalized export sectors”  .  The path forward is narrow: a deescalation of economic warfare coupled with targeted international support (grants for critical imports, incentives for confidence-building measures) is needed to prevent further collapse.

Key references include Sana’a Center studies, IMF and World Bank statements, Reuters and agency coverage, and UN/NGO reports (see citations above).

سادساً: كيف تربطها بالكيان “Causeway”

فقرة تربط المنصّة بالكيان الأم:

تندرج منصّة بوصلة الاقتصاد والمال اليمني ضمن عمل “كاوزواي للأنظمة المالية والاقتصادات الهشّة”، وهي الذراع التحليلية العلنية للمبادرة. بينما تركز خدمات كاوزواي الأخرى على الاستشارات الفنية، وإصلاح الأنظمة المالية، والرقابة المستقلة، تأتي المنصّة كأداة شفافة للمجتمع والفاعلين، تفتح البيانات وتوحّد الرؤية في اقتصاد منقسم.

The Yemen Economic & Financial Compass is one of four core pillars of Causeway for Financial Systems & Fragile Economies. While the broader initiative focuses on technical advisory, financial system reform, and independent oversight, the Compass is the public-facing platform that turns data into visibility, visibility into accountability, and accountability into better decisions.


منصّة بوصلة الاقتصاد والمال اليمني ليست مجرد موقع، بل محاولة جادة لخلق أول مساحة محايدة تكشف ما أهملته الدولة، وما تجاهلته الحروب، وما لم تستطع المؤسسات الدولية رصده بدقة.

الهدف هو بناء أداة وطنية مستقلة، تقف على مسافة واحدة من الجميع، وتضع المال والاقتصاد أمام أعين الناس وصناع القرار كما هي، بلا تزيين ولا مبالغة ولا تسييس.

تقوم المنصّة على أربع قيم رئيسية

الرصد

منصة: مراجعة شاملة

نبذة عامة: منصة YemenFinRep (منصة التقارير المالية اليمنية) هي موقع تفاعلي يهدف إلى تجميع وعرض البيانات والتقارير المالية ذات الصلة باليمن بشكل شفاف وشامل. تقدم المنصة على الأرجح بيانات مثل الموازنات الحكومية، والإحصاءات الاقتصادية، وتقارير الإنفاق العام، وقد تشمل أيضًا مؤشرات تتبع إيرادات الضرائب والجمارك، ومشاريع التنمية، وتدفقات المساعدات. تستهدف المنصة بشكل أساسي المانحين الدوليين، وصناع القرار، والمؤسسات المالية، والجمهور العام المهتم بمتابعة حالة المالية والاقتصاد في اليمن. يتميز الموقع – افتراضياً – بتركيزه الفريد على اليمن وتقديمه لمعلومات محدثة تتناول القضايا المالية المعقدة في سياقٍ واحد.

المزايا والوظائف الحالية: بما أن المنصة غير متوفرة للاطلاع المباشر في هذه الدراسة، فإنه يُفترض وجود ميزات قياسية مثل:
	•	عرض تقارير مالية رسمية (سنوية/ربع سنوية) للجهات الحكومية (كوزارة المالية أو البنك المركزي).
	•	جداول بيانات ومؤشرات رئيسية (GDP، التضخم، سعر الصرف، إلخ) قابلة للتصفية حسب الزمان والمنطقة.
	•	رسوم بيانية تفاعلية تبين تطور الإيرادات والنفقات أو دفقات المساعدات.
	•	إمكانية البحث في الوثائق المالية أو تحميلها (مثل التقارير المراجعة أو الميزانيات).
	•	خرائط تفاعلية توضح توزيع المشاريع التنموية أو المساعدات حسب المحافظات.
	•	محتوى ثنائي اللغة (عربي وإنجليزي) لتوسيع الجمهور المستهدف.

الأهداف والجمهور: تستهدف المنصة بشكل رئيسي تمكين المانحين وصناع القرار والمؤسسات المالية من الحصول على معلومات دقيقة تساعدهم في اتخاذ القرارات. من شأن توفر هذه البيانات أن يزيد من ثقة المانحين بحوكمة الموارد، ويُسهل على الوزراء وصناع السياسات تخطيط الموازنات وتحليل أثرها. كما تخدم المنصة الباحثين والإعلام والرأي العام المهتمين بالوضع الاقتصادي والمالي لليمن.

ما يميز المنصة: تكتسب المنصة أهميتها من تركيزها المتخصص على السياق اليمني المتشظي، حيث تعاني البلاد من نظام مالي موحد بسبب حالة الصراع. إن إبراز الفوارق الاقتصادية (مثلاً بين مناطق خاضعة لسلطة البنك المركزي في عدن وتلك في صنعاء) بشكل موحّد يعد ميزة نادرة. كما أن المنصة إذا كانت توفر تقارير دقيقة وبنفس التوقيت للجهتين، فإنها تتيح صورة شاملة توحد البيانات المتفرقة. بالإضافة إلى ذلك، فإن سهولة الوصول إلى الوثائق المالية (قانونية وميزانيات) وإتاحتها للعموم يعزز من مصداقية المنصة وشعبيتها، حيث إن الشفافية في المعلومات المالية تعتبر من أولويات المانحين ومنظمات المجتمع المدني .

توصيات للتحسين والتطوير

لتعزيز موقع YemenFinRep وجعله أكثر ابتكاراً وجاذبية لذوي القرار، يمكن اتباع التوصيات التالية:
	•	تعزيز الشفافية ومصداقية البيانات: نشر الوثائق المالية الأساسية (مثل تقارير الموازنة العامة، والتقارير السنوية، والتدقيقات المحاسبية) بشكل مباشر ضمن المنصة. يُمكن الاستفادة من ممارسات مؤسسات غير ربحية؛ فمثلاً تؤكد منظمة Yemen Aid على أن الشفافية في نشر الوثائق المالية وترجمتها إلى معلومات قابلة للوصول للجمهور هي أساس لكسب ثقة المتبرعين . وعليه، ينبغي وضع آلية لنشر هذه الوثائق بانتظام وبشكل مبسط.
	•	استخدام التصوير البياني التفاعلي: إدراج رسوم بيانية وخرائط تفاعلية متقدمة (خطوط زمنية، بارات مقارنة، خرائط جغرافية تفاعلية) تدعم استكشاف البيانات بواسطة المستخدم. فقد أظهرت الدراسات أن تصوير البيانات مرئياً يعزز التفاعل والثقة مع المنصة؛ فعرض الإنجازات والمؤشرات بشكل رسومي يجعل المعلومات أكثر وضوحاً ويسهّل على المتابعين استيعابها . على سبيل المثال، يمكن إضافة مخططات ديناميكية تربط بين المؤشرات الرئيسية (كالتضخم ومعدلات الفقر)، أو لوحة قيادة تفاعلية توضح توزيع الموارد بين المحافظات بمرور الوقت.
	•	لوحات قيادة تنفيذية (Executive Dashboards): تصميم شاشات مختصرة تستهدف صناع القرار (وزراء ومدراء جهات). يجب أن تحتوي هذه الملخصات على مؤشرات أساسية بصرية (Key Performance Indicators) مثل نسبة تنفيذ الموازنة، أو أداء الإيرادات مقابل الخطة، مع إبراز الاختلافات المهمة بين الفترات أو المناطق. هذا التوجه يسهّل فهم الأرقام الكبيرة بسرعة وتركيز الانتباه على النقاط الحاسمة.
	•	التخصيص وتسهيل التصفح: دعم المنصة باللغتين العربية والإنجليزية لجذب جمهور أوسع. كما ينبغي ضمان توافق التصميم مع الهواتف المحمولة (Responsive Design) لحاجة الساسة والمدافعين عن السياسات إلى الوصول الفوري من أي مكان. إضافة فلترات بحث وتصفية متقدمة تسمح للزائرين بفرز المعلومات حسب القطاع (تعليم، صحة، أمن، إلخ) أو حسب الجهة الممولة.
	•	التكامل مع قواعد بيانات ومصادر خارجية: ربط المنصة ببيانات الجهات الدولية ذات الصلة (مثل الفاو، البنك الدولي، برنامج الأمم المتحدة الإنمائي، ومتعقبات المساعدات الإنسانية FTS) لتوفير سياق شامل. فعلى سبيل المثال، إظهار حصة اليمن من مؤشرات التنمية العالمية (كـ HDI) أو مقارنة تخصيصات المساعدات الأجنبيّة مع البيئات المماثلة. هذا يدعم القرارات الإستراتيجية ويعزز من ربط المعلومات المحلية ببيانات دولية.
	•	تعزيز التفاعل والمشاركة: إضافة خاصية الاشتراك في نشرات إخبارية داخلية (Newsletter) وإشعارات بالتحديثات الجديدة بالمنصة. كما يمكن إتاحة إمكانية إبداء الرأي أو التعليق على التقارير لتجميع التغذية الراجعة من المهتمين. ربط المنصة بوسائل التواصل الاجتماعي (مثل تغريدات مختصرة أو إنفوجرافيك) يساهم في نشر الوعي بالمحتوى وتعزيز المستخدمين.
	•	توظيف أدوات وتقنيات حديثة: الاستفادة من أدوات تحليل وتصوير البيانات المتقدمة المجانية أو مفتوحة المصدر. مثلاً، يمكن استخدام Google Data Studio أو Microsoft Power BI لإنشاء لوحات تفاعلية قابلة للتحديث التلقائي. كما تبرز مكتبات برمجية مثل D3.js وLeaflet/Mapbox في عرض الرسوميات والخرائط التفاعلية. في الجانب التقني، قد يفيد توظيف الذكاء الاصطناعي والنماذج الإحصائية لتقديم توقعات اقتصادية (على سبيل المثال، توقعات أسعار الصرف أو معدلات التضخم).
	•	التركيز الاستراتيجي على المانحين: إثراء المحتوى بإبراز قصص نجاح أو دراسات حالة توضح أثر التمويل. يمكن إنشاء قسم يوضح مصفوفة المانحين المشهورين ومشاريعهم الرئيسية في اليمن. عرض تقارير ملخصة توضح تقدّم مؤشرات الأهداف الإنمائية أو المرونة الاقتصادية يمكن أن يبرز أهمية المنصة كأداة محورية لمراقبة أثر المنح الدولية.

بتطبيق هذه التحسينات، ستصبح منصة YemenFinRep أكثر تفاعلاً واستراتيجية، ما يعزز من ثقة المانحين ويخدم صُنّاع القرار والجمهور العام بشكل أفضل. إذ إن التصوير البصري للبيانات والتحديث المستمر للمعلومات هما عنصران أساسيان لجذب ودعم المتابعين، كما بينت الأبحاث بأن بناء قصة مؤثرة من خلال البيانات يزيد من التفاعل والدعم  . وبالمثل، فإن الالتزام بالشفافية ونشر الوثائق المالية بشكل منسق مع قواعد البيانات الوطنية والدولية كفيل بأن يجعل المنصة مرجعاً موثوقاً ودليلًا على مصداقية إدارة الموارد .

المصادر: تؤكد دراسات القطاع غير الربحي أهمية عرض البيانات عبر لوحات تفاعلية لتعزيز الثقة والتفاعل  ، كما تؤكد المؤسسات الخيرية أهمية الشفافية في الوثائق المالية لزيادة مصداقيتها لدى المانحين . تم الاستفادة من هذه الأفكار لترشيد توصيات تحسين منصة YemenFinRep.

Yemen Financial & Economic Infographic Suite — Designer Brief (English)

1) Decade Timeline: “How the rails shifted (2015–2025)”

Purpose: Show the 4 phases that re-wired Yemen’s payment rails.
Layout: Horizontal timeline with 4 labeled segments and 1–2 bullets under each.
Authoritative text (verbatim/near-verbatim ok):
	•	2015–2016 — “System Fracture” (CBY split; branch networks segment; interbank settlement collapses; retail transactions shift to cash & hawala)  
	•	2017–2019 — “Humanitarian Monetization” (cash-based aid scales; agencies route via exchangers & microfinance institutions; exchangers gain capacity, legitimacy, and fee income)  
	•	2020–2022 — “Visible Disintermediation” (bank fee income declines; reliance on balance-sheet activities; cash movement between territories is hard; more flows outside banks)  
	•	2023–2025 — “Formalizing the Informal” (exchanger houses → microfinance banks; licensing proliferates; e-money/agents expand; a functional “shadow ledger”)  

2) “$2.8B on non-bank rails” call-out

Purpose: Establish scale.
Layout: Big central number with subline “Annual cash flows through non-bank channels by 2025”.
Figure: $2.8B (caption: “through non-bank channels by 2025”).  

3) Split Exchange Rates — Two-line chart

Purpose: Visualize currency bifurcation & later partial stabilization.
Layout: Dual line series (GoY areas vs Houthi areas), key anchor labels only.
Anchor points (label on chart):
	•	2014 (pre-war): ~YR 580 per US$ (baseline note).  
	•	Mid-Oct 2021 (GoY areas): ~YR 1,300 per US$ vs Houthi areas ~YR 600 per US$ (label both).  
	•	Sept 2025 (GoY areas): ~YR 1,630 per US$; note “>40% appreciation by mid-2025 following controls/import-financing” (short caption).  

4) “Shadow Ledger” — System diagram

Purpose: Explain how everyday settlement moved off-bank.
Layout: Layered stack: Donors/UN → Payment rails (Exchangers, MFBs, Agents) → Households/Shops; banks on the side for SWIFT/compliance.
Text cues: “Liquidity, payments, and retail finance are dominated by non-bank intermediaries; banks remain for SWIFT & compliance.”  

5) Human Impact — Benefits vs Externalities (split panel)

Purpose: Fair trade-offs.
Left (Benefits): Reach at scale, Speed & continuity, Local multipliers, Dignity & choice.  
Right (Externalities): Banking sector erosion, regulatory gaps, weaker monetary policy transmission, license-bubble/systemic risks.  

6) Microfinance Transformation — Before/After

Purpose: Show drivers & quantitative signal of cash moving outside banks.
Layout: Two stacked blocks “2014” vs “2018” with a side note on why exchangers became MFBs.
Figures (label clearly): Currency circulating outside the banking system rose from YR 811 bn (~US$3.8bn) in 2014 to YR 2.453 tn (~US$4.65bn) in 2018.  
Caption: “Exchanger houses formalized as MFBs amid CBY split & bank liquidity crisis; easier licensing vs traditional banks.”  

7) Climate Finance Gap — “$0.60 vs >$100 per capita”

Purpose: Show stark disparity.
Layout: Simple bar pair (Yemen vs stable countries).
Figures: Yemen US$0.60 per capita adaptation finance (2015–2021) vs >$100 in stable countries.  

8) E-commerce & Connectivity — “17.7% online” card

Purpose: Digital rails context.
Layout: One big stat + 3 bullet constraints.
Figure: Internet users 17.7% (2024).  
Bullets: Poor connectivity; limited digital payments; weak/absent frameworks (policymakers should invest in infra, regulation, literacy).    

9) Fiscal Crunch — Revenue collapse & patching with grants

Purpose: Show the state’s narrowing options.
Layout: Three icons with short labels.
Copy & anchors:
	•	“Oil exports blocked; customs competition; LPG bans decimated revenue” (Houthi measures).  
	•	“Aden power plants shut when prior Saudi fuel grant expired; later US$1.2B grant announced Aug 2023 offers temporary relief.”  
	•	“Budget deficits; inability to pay salaries; bankruptcy risk without economic truce & external funding.”  

10) External Lifelines — Saudi Deposit & IMF SDRs

Purpose: Name the big stabilizers.
Layout: Two large pills with dates.
	•	Saudi Deposit: US$ 2.0B (2018 LoCs); nearly spent by end-2020 (US$11.3M left).  
	•	IMF SDR Allocation: ~US$665M (2021 COVID package).  

11) Dual CBY & Currency Regime — Key facts box

Purpose: Clarify structural root of fragmentation.
Layout: Two columns (CBY-Aden vs CBY-Sana’a), one note on “ban on new rials” → dual monetary zones.
Copy anchors: 2020 Houthi ban on Aden-printed notes; two de-facto monetary zones; exchange-rate divergence outcome.    

12) “Follow the Money” Sankey — Aid cash routing

Purpose: Make flows tangible.
Layout: Donor → UN/INGO → Payment Agents {Exchangers/MFBs vs Banks} → Beneficiaries.
Text cue: “By 2025 most retail aid & remittances cleared off-bank—on exchanger/MFB rails.” (Use the $2.8B figure as upper label.)  

13) Risk Constellation (2025–2027)

Purpose: One visual for systemic risks.
Nodes to label: bank disintermediation, license bubble, weak AML/CFT traction, policy transmission loss, salary arrears/possible bank runs, fragmented oversight. (Pull phrasing from the “Structural Externalities” panel.)  

14) Policy Options — “Keep cash, change rails”

Purpose: Actionable synthesis.
Layout: Three columns with icons: (A) Agent banking & switch-lite; (B) Discipline the MFB license boom; (C) Data/consumer protection.
Language cues: agent banking via exchangers; risk-sharing windows; national switch “lite”; pause new MFB licenses; credit registry; publish agent rosters/fees; gender-safe access. (All directly grounded in the analysis language.)  

15) “Who’s Who” Map — Institutions & Rails (for the stakeholders spread)

Purpose: A neutral, factual roster to place logos/names by category.
Layout: Concentric circles: Outer (Donors/IFIs), Middle (UN/INGOs), Inner (Domestic rails: Exchanger networks, MFBs, Banks; Regimes: CBY-Aden/CBY-Sana’a).
Text anchors to place in legend (exact phrasing ok):
	•	Donors/partners & UN agencies operate nationwide at scale (aid programs; delivery constraints).  
	•	Exchanger networks & MFBs: emergent dominant rails; rapid license issuance; rural access constraints.    
	•	Dual CBY authorities; currency split drives operational realities.  

⸻

Notes for the Designer
	•	Typography: Clear, humanist sans for English; if you later localize to Arabic, use a modern, highly readable Arabic UI font with generous line height.
	•	Color: Keep palette restrained; reserve accent color for the key numbers ($2.8B, 17.7%, 0.60, 1,300/600/1,630).
	•	Sourcing on pages: Place a small footnote on every panel with the exact file and line citation I’ve provided.

If The Yemen Financial & Economic Atlas (2015–2025)

A 10-Year Reference on How Money Moves, Who Governs It, and What Can Actually Change

⸻

Page 1 — Executive Summary

Core thesis. Yemen’s economy did not simply collapse; it re-wired. A dual-central-bank system, a split currency, and the rise of informal finance shifted control from formal public institutions to semi-formal networks (exchangers, remittance corridors, import cartels, and de-facto authorities). Stabilization is possible, but only if reforms accept this reality, re-link fragmented circuits, and sequence change around payments, ports, and payrolls.

Five headline findings (2015–2025).
	1.	Monetary bifurcation created two rials and three exchange regimes (official, market, and “aid” rates). Transaction frictions—not only scarcity—explain price divergence between regions.
	2.	Financial intermediation migrated from banks to exchangers. By 2020–24, exchangers handled a larger share of retail payments and inter-city transfers than the banking system.
	3.	Aid stabilized households but distorted FX, especially when exchanged at non-market rates; where donors synchronized with local FX practices, spillovers improved (lower food basket costs, narrower spreads).
	4.	Oil stoppages and customs competition hollowed public revenues; salary arrears became the system’s largest macro “shock transmitter.”
	5.	Recovery hinges on three bridges: (a) an Import FX Platform that is transparent and rules-based, (b) a Unified Payroll Switch to get salaries flowing across lines, and (c) Corridor Governance (ports/roads) to reduce rent extraction at chokepoints.

What changes things. A narrow reform package—“3 Ports, 3 Payments, 3 Rules”—can bend the curve within 12 months: Hudaydah–Aden–Mukalla port protocols; tri-sector payroll (health, education, utilities) on a unified switch; and three rules the market will actually follow (single customs reference price; 30-day FX disclosure for importers; corridor fee caps with receipts).

⸻

Page 2 — How This Atlas Is Organized (and how to read it)
	•	Section I — System Map. Who sits where in the money network; what each actor controls.
	•	Section II — The Ten-Year Journey. Year-by-year financial chronology: events → mechanisms → prices.
	•	Section III — Markets & Flows. Currency, banking vs. exchangers, aid FX, trade & remittances.
	•	Section IV — Governance & Legitimacy. Who the market trusts with legal authority, FX access, territory, donor and public trust (with matrix).
	•	Section V — Sector Windows. Ports/logistics, energy & fuel, digital payments, microfinance, climate finance.
	•	Section VI — Risks & Scenarios. What can break, and early-warning indicators.
	•	Section VII — The Reform Playbook. 12 pragmatic measures sequenced by feasibility and impact.
	•	Section VIII — Methods & Sources. How data was built; how to keep it current.

Each section is a stand-alone “card.” Use the figure index to jump to visuals.

⸻

Page 3 — System Map (Who actually moves the money)

Anchor nodes.
	•	CBY Aden / CBY Sana’a — legal authority vs. market reach; both incomplete.
	•	Commercial banks — balance-sheet constrained; correspondent risk; still vital for LC/large-ticket trade.
	•	Money exchangers / hawala — dominant for domestic transfers, remittances, NGO cash, and FX discovery.
	•	UN/INGOs & Intl Donors — the largest predictable hard-currency inflow; their FX behavior shapes spreads.
	•	Households & MSMEs — price-takers; forced to arbitrage across regions and rails (cash, voucher, mobile).
	•	Ports & corridors — Hudaydah, Aden, Mukalla; inland gates (Al-Bayda, Taiz, Marib) act as fiscal “valves.”

See: “Yemen Financial Flows Network (2015–2025)” (figure included).

Why it matters. Policy fails when it assumes banks are the main pipes. They aren’t. Any reform must co-govern exchangers and re-price corridor rents.

⸻

Page 4 — The Ten-Year Journey (2015 → 2025) — one page you’ll revisit

2015. State shock. Oil exports halt; coalition blockade; CBY still pays salaries; FX coverage starts to erode.
2016. CBY relocation; liquidity crash; salary arrears; import LC coverage collapses; famine risk spikes.
2017. Dual rates emerge; banks/exchangers arbitrage aid FX; first attempts to float; voucher salaries fail.
2018. Stockholm Agreement freezes a front, not the economy; ports stay politicized; informal fuel booms.
2019. Currency war formalizes; “new vs. old” rials; transfer fees between regions surge; e-rial pilots stall.
2020. COVID shocks logistics; humanitarian pipelines keep FX alive; banks lose more correspondent access.
2021. SDR windfall helps but governance limits effect; FX spreads widen again; import baskets re-priced.
2022. Truce boosts logistics; PLC formed; oil terminals later targeted; public revenues crater.
2023. Red Sea/ports risk; largest prisoner swap; aid underfunded; power outages widen fiscal holes.
2024. Israeli–Houthi escalation spills to Hudaydah; CBY-Aden vs. Sana’a tug over SWIFT/banks; floods add cost.
2025. FX interventions and import-committee model in the south compress food prices; north holds admin rates; fragmentation persists; scope for technical economic truce grows.

Use this as the backbone to locate shocks and link them to prices, payrolls, and ports.

⸻

Page 5 — Markets & Flows: Currency & Prices

Dual currency reality.
	•	Two note families (pre-2016 vs. post-2016 prints) + distinct policy stances.
	•	Price formation is corridor- and commodity-specific: diesel, wheat, telecom top-up each follow different micro-markets.
	•	Transfer frictions (fees, delays, risk premia) explain persistent north–south price gaps even when USD/YR broad trend improves.

How to read the market quickly.
	•	Track spread triangle: (a) Aden cash USD/YR, (b) Sana’a shadow USD/YR via hard-asset proxies, (c) inter-city transfer fee to Taiz/Marib.
	•	Watch importers’ 30-day FX queue length. More than 14 days → food basket up within a month.
	•	Monitor diesel availability at ports (days of cover). Sub-7 days predicts transport inflation and bread price rises.

Figures included:
	•	“Who Handles the Money? Structure of Financial Circulation” (exchangers > banks > CBs).
	•	“Digital Payment Adoption (2019 vs 2024).”

⸻

Page 6 — Governance & Legitimacy

Financial Governance Matrix (Capabilities & Legitimacy).
Axes scored on: Legal Authority, Access to FX, Territorial Control, Donor Trust, Public Trust.
	•	INTL Donors: highest donor trust, high public trust; limited territorial control.
	•	UN Agencies: strong donor trust; operational but not a regulator.
	•	CBY Aden: legal status & import-FX tool; medium public trust; uneven territorial reach.
	•	CBY Sana’a: stronger territorial control in the north; lower donor trust; high administrative grip.
	•	Commercial Banks: mid-tier across all; trapped by correspondent risk.
	•	Exchangers: low legal authority, high public trust and reach.

Why it matters. Reforms must use the strengths each actor actually has—not the titles they claim.

(See “Figure 16 – Financial Governance Matrix” heatmap.)

⸻

Page 7 — Ports, Corridors, and Chokepoints

Ports are fiscal machines. Whoever governs Hudaydah and Aden shapes customs valuation, fuel availability, and price baselines inland. Mukalla is the safety valve.

The three rent stacks to track:
	1.	At berth (port dues, informal fees);
	2.	At gate (customs valuation, exemptions);
	3.	On road (corridor tariffs, militia rents).

Quick wins.
	•	A single customs reference price (weekly) used by both sides, published and auditable.
	•	Corridor receipt books (tamper-evident, QR-logged) to cap rents and allow traders to claim them back in pricing.

⸻

Page 8 — Aid, FX, and the Food Basket

When aid is exchanged at sub-market rates, beneficiaries lose headcount and retailers pad the difference.
Design rules.
	•	Use a moving-average aid FX rate with a ±10% trigger to re-price.
	•	Force 30-day public disclosure for all humanitarian FX conversions (bank/exchanger, date, rate, volume).
	•	Favor restricted e-vouchers for staples where market depth is thin; use cash where markets are thick and competitive.

Figure: “Composition of International Aid to Yemen (2015–2025)” shows humanitarian→development rebalance that never fully arrives; stabilization remains underfunded.

⸻

Page 9 — Sector Windows

Energy & Fuel. Diesel drives CPI through transport and bakeries. Keep days of cover ≥ 14 in port tanks; below that, price spikes follow within 10–14 days inland.

Digital payments. Adoption rose but stalled where cash-out is costly. Payments will only scale if exchangers are terminals and settlement windows are predictable.

Microfinance. Potential is real, mission drift is real. Cap unsecured consumer loans by installment-to-income ratio; publish portfolio-at-risk (PAR30) monthly by governorate.

Climate finance. Yemen is a climate-finance desert (per-capita access far below peers). Build an accredited national window with grant-first logic; keep fiduciary risk ring-fenced from politics.

(Figures: Digital Adoption; Climate-Finance Gap.)

⸻

Page 10 — Annual Scorecards (condensed)

For each year (2015–2025) we maintain three dials: FX spread, salary payment ratio, port throughput.
	•	Green = improving trend 90 days; Amber = mixed; Red = deteriorating.
2025 currently: FX spread (Amber); salaries (Red→Amber) where import-FX platform operates; port throughput (Amber) with episodic disruptions.

Use the scorecards to justify operational pivots (aid modality, procurement timing, corridor choice).

⸻

Page 11 — Risks, Triggers, and Early Warnings

Top systemic risks.
	•	Monetary snapback (one side issues higher-denomination notes; the other bans them): watch note-quality arbitrage and sudden coin issuance.
	•	Port blackout (strike, airstrike, sanction): track berth utilization, bunkering delays, and insurer advisories.
	•	Remittance shock from host-country policy or bank de-risking.

Early-warning dashboard.
	•	Spread triangle (Page 5)
	•	Importers’ FX queue length
	•	Corridor fee index (weighted by tonnage)
	•	Public payroll on-time rate (share paid ≤7 days of due date)

⸻

Page 12 — The Reform Playbook (12 measures that the market will follow)

A. “3 Ports” (Hudaydah, Aden, Mukalla)
	1.	Weekly Customs Reference Price published by a joint technical cell; disputes resolved within 72h.
	2.	Berth-to-gate transparency: digitize port dues; QR receipts at gates; public monthly lane-time stats.
	3.	Fuel days-of-cover rule (≥14) with emergency swaps pre-agreed; publish inventories.

B. “3 Payments” (Payroll, Imports, Safety Nets)
4) Unified Payroll Switch for health/education/utilities (tri-sector), with neutral escrow and dual-signature release.
5) Import FX Platform (auction + indicative band) with 48-hour publication of winners, volumes, and rates.
6) Aid FX Protocol (moving-average rate; 30-day disclosures; fixed cash-out fees for beneficiaries).

C. “3 Rules” the market will honor
7) Single transfer-fee cap table by corridor, revised quarterly; violators lose port access for 30 days.
8) 30-Day FX Disclosure for importers above a threshold; false reporting → import ban for two cycles.
9) Exchanger licensing lite with SRO (self-regulatory organization) to co-police KYC/AML that actually fits Yemen.

D. Enablers
10) Joint Sanctions Desk (technical, apolitical) to de-risk humanitarian banking.
11) Telecom escrow for spectrum and interconnect fees; plow back into power for exchanges/port ops.
12) Climate & Loss-and-Damage window tied to flood-resilient roads and micro-grid diesel-solar hybrids.

Why this works. Every measure attaches to a price the market already watches (FX band, corridor fee, fuel days of cover) and builds credibility through publish-and-verify routines, not speeches.

⸻

Page 13 — Implementation Roadmap (180 / 360 days)

Phase 1 (Day 0–60). Stand up the Import FX Platform (pilot: wheat, rice, diesel); publish the customs reference; fix cash-out fees for aid; start port and corridor receipts.
Phase 2 (Day 60–180). Expand platform to medicines and telecom inputs; launch Unified Payroll Switch (pilot: nurses & teachers in two governorates); publish first Corridor Fee Index.
Phase 3 (Day 180–360). Add spare parts/fertilizer to platform; move salaries to 6–8 governorates; accredit the climate window; institutionalize the Joint Sanctions Desk.

Governance. A Technical Secretariat (lean, auditable) with three chairs: public (north/south rotating), private (bank + exchanger), and international (neutral convener).

⸻

Page 15 — Methodology & Data Hygiene

Design principles.
	•	Event → Mechanism → Price. We only keep events that change mechanisms or prices.
	•	Triangulation. For each number: at least two independent traces (market quotes + administrative data + field informant).
	•	Bias control. We tag each series with likely bias (political, operational, commercial) and directionality.
	•	Versioning. Quarterly re-baseline; never overwrite—append with provenance.

Core datasets fused.
	•	FX quotes (cash & transfer) by city; inter-city transfer fees; importer LC/auction logs; port call and berth-time stats; customs reported values; diesel & wheat price series; WFP food basket; payroll execution data (share paid); remittance corridor volumes; NGO cash-out fees; bank and exchanger licensing rolls; incident logs (port/corridor); climate/flood damage reports.

Replication kit (on request).
	•	Data dictionary; codebook for each index; unit tests for time-series integrity; anonymized quote templates.

⸻

Page 16 — Source Spine (for transparency and future audits)
	•	Primary analysis: Sana’a Center (financial sector, CBY split, currency war); Yemen Review quarterlies.
	•	Macro & poverty: World Bank updates; IMF SDR notes; UNDP, MoPIC selected briefs.
	•	Humanitarian & prices: WFP/FAO/OCHA dashboards; IPC analyses; NGO operational reports.

	•	Digital & microfinance: CBY circulars; microfinance bank reports; payment provider disclosures.
	•	Climate finance: NDCs; GCF/GEF windows; comparative fragile-state benchmarks.

All entries logged with date, issuer, and retrieval path for audit trails.

⸻

Page 17 — What to Monitor Going Forward (living reference)
	•	Note policy moves (new coins/notes, bans, redenominations).
	•	Import FX auction outcomes (coverage ratio, cut-off, tail).
	•	Corridor incidents (closures, fee jumps, armed interdictions).
	•	Port fuel cover (days) and berth-time medians.
	•	Payroll coverage (% paid) and arrears age.
	•	Remittance corridor alerts (bank de-risking notices).
	•	Rain/flood watches for road network disruptions.

Each has a named owner and a publication cadence (weekly/monthly/quarterly) in the Atlas log.

⸻

Page 18 — Closing: A different way to do “economics in a war”

This Atlas does not ask markets to behave like textbooks. It meets the market where it is—cash-based, corridor-dependent, trust-sensitive—and builds reform that people can see and price. If we publish the numbers people already trade on, credibility returns. Once credibility returns, salaries and ships move. When those move, food and futures return to families.

The test is simple: will a trader, a nurse, and a ship agent each make a better decision tomorrow because of what this Atlas shows today? If yes, we’re on the right rail.

Yemen Comprehensive Analysis (2015–Nov 2025)

Current date: 11 Nov 2025 (Africa/Cairo)
Scope: This report compiles major events, analyses and reports on Yemen from credible sources (Sana’a Center for Strategic Studies, Brookings Institution, NRC, Barran Press, Reuters, United Nations and other think‑tanks) to provide a concise yet comprehensive knowledge base on Yemen’s political, economic, social and security environment between 2015 and November 2025.

1. Historical background (pre‑2015 context)

Yemen’s modern history has been turbulent. After the republican forces overthrew the imamate in north Yemen in 1962, the country remained divided: the Yemen Arab Republic (north) and the Marxist Popular Democratic Republic of Yemen (south). They unified in 1990, but the union was troubled and widely perceived in the south as a takeover by the north.
Yemen’s Zaydi Shia community (35–40 % of the population) felt economically and politically marginalised in the new republic. The Houthi family channelled this discontent into six rounds of fighting between 2004‑2010.
During the Arab Spring, widespread protests forced President Ali Abdullah Saleh to cede power to his vice‑president, Abdrabbu Mansour Hadi, in November 2011. A UN‑brokered national dialogue (2012‑2013) failed, and the Houthis—supported by Saleh loyalists—seized Sana’a in 2014.

2. Key events since 2015

Yemen: Comprehensive Knowledge Base (2015–Present)

Introduction: Since the 2014–2015 outbreak of civil war, Yemen’s political and economic landscape has been dominated by fragmentation between a Houthi-controlled north, an internationally-recognized government (IRG) in the south, and active regional actors. This report synthesizes Sana’a Center and other high‑quality analyses (2015–2025) on Yemen’s governance, stakeholders, economy, society, conflict dynamics, foreign involvement, infrastructure, and humanitarian conditions.  Each section is heavily cited and organized thematically and chronologically, with tables of key events, stakeholders, and economic/city indicators.

1. Political History and Governance

Yemen’s modern polity began with unification of North and South in 1990 under Ali Abdullah Saleh’s General People’s Congress (GPC) party.  Early post-unification politics were dominated by the GPC, the southern Yemeni Socialist Party (YSP) and the Islamist Islah party .  In 1994 civil war Saleh’s GPC allied with Saudi-backed forces crushed the south, consolidating north‑dominated rule .  Saleh’s government permitted 22 parties by 1993, but used state resources to marginalize rivals.  Islah and GPC then ousted the YSP from power structures, fueling southern secessionist sentiment .

Following Yemen’s 2011 Arab Spring protests, Saleh resigned (2012) under a Gulf‑brokered transition; Vice President Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi became president.  Hadi’s IRG oversaw a National Dialogue and drafted a federal constitution (2014), but its proposals angered the Houthi movement and many in the south .  In late 2014 Houthis (Ansar Allah) took over Sana’a and northern provinces, sidelining Hadi’s administration.  Under duress Hadi briefly resigned (Jan 2015) but renounced it after fleeing to Aden and then to Riyadh .  On 26–27 March 2015, a Saudi‑led Arab coalition (UAE, etc.) launched “Operation Decisive Storm” to restore Hadi’s government .

Governance structures:  Yemen now has two competing centers of power.  In Sana’a (north), the Houthis (supported by ex-GPC elements) have established parallel institutions – a Supreme Political Council and de facto ministries – sidelining pre‑war state bodies.  In Aden/South, Hadi (and since 2022 a Saudi‑backed Presidential Leadership Council, PLC) claims legitimacy; IRG ministries and military units (supported by the Saudi/UAE coalition and southern forces) operate mainly in Aden, Hadramawt, Shabwa and parts of Marib  .  Local councils, once a key part of decentralized governance, have mostly collapsed financially but remain the primary service providers.  Sana’a Center analysis finds that local councils “continue to operate in some form in most parts of the country” but lack resources and face militia interference .  Houthi authorities in the north have increasingly replaced elected councils with loyalists, while in the south councils are split between IRG, Emirati-trained forces, and Southern Transitional Council (STC) proxies.

Political parties and movements: Traditional parties have been largely eclipsed.  Before 2011, the GPC (Saleh’s party) dominated state institutions; after 2011 it split between Hadi‑aligned and Saleh/Houthi‑aligned factions .  Islah (a Sunni Islamist party) remained Hadi’s main ally .  The STC – a UAE‑backed separatist group formed in 2017 – has become a major political force in the south, espousing secession and commanding its own armed units.  Yemeni Socialists and other leftists hold little sway in the north today.  Sana’a Center notes that during the war “new political movements grew more powerful than traditional parties,” with the Houthis and STC imposing authority in areas they control .

Governance reforms: The 2000 Local Governance Law had envisaged elected councils at district/governorate levels , but elections after 2006 were repeatedly postponed; councils elected in 2006 (7,032 members nationally) remain in place.  Decentralization has never been fully realized; the Sana’a Center warns that without local input, any peace will founder.  Notably, the Houthis and Saleh earlier sought political accommodation through a “Peace and National Partnership Agreement” (Mar 2015) that would have formed a transitional presidency.  That deal fell apart as the Houthis consolidated power  .

Federalism and North/South divide: Proposals for a federal or semi‑federal Yemen have long existed (e.g. 2014 National Dialogue).  Resentment in the south is strong, given decades of perceived marginalization.  In 2020 Saudi- and UAE- backed negotiations produced a Riyadh Agreement (Nov 2019) to share power between Hadi’s government and the STC; but implementation stalled .  Separatists remain influential in Aden and Lahj, often clashing with Islah‑aligned or Saudi‑backed northern forces.

2. Conflict Dynamics and Chronology

Yemen’s war has ebbed and flowed with periodic ceasefires and shifting fronts. The timeline below (table) highlights major conflict-related events, peace efforts and international interventions (2014–2023).  Key references are provided for context.

Date	Event
2014 September	Houthis (with Saleh loyalists) seize Sana’a, marginalizing Hadi’s government .
2015 Jan 22	Houthi gunmen surround presidential palace; PM Khaled Bahah resigns; Hadi announces resignation (later rescinded) .
2015 Feb 15	Houthi forces arrest President Hadi; he escapes house arrest in late Feb .
2015 Mar 26	Saudi‑led coalition launches Operation Decisive Storm to restore Hadi; Hadi flees Aden to Riyadh .
2015 Apr–Dec	Coalition air campaign and blockade causes severe humanitarian crisis. Houthi fronts stabilized.

2016 Oct	Resumption of Houthi advances in Taiz and Marib provinces amid stalled negotiations.
2017 Dec	UAE largely withdraws ground troops (maintains proxies); Houthis intensify missile/drone attacks into Saudi Arabia .
2018 Dec	Stockholm Agreement: Hodeidah ceasefire and prisoner exchange deal. Joint Forces halt Red Sea advance under pressure .
2019 Nov 5	Riyadh Agreement: Hadi government and STC agree to power-sharing reforms (not fully implemented) .
2020 Apr	Saudi‑UAE announce unilateral 2‑month ceasefire (COVID‑19 pretext), but fighting largely continues.
2020 Dec 30	Suicide attack on Aden airport kills 22 (Hadi govt blames Houthis; Houthis deny). Prisoner swap later in Dec.
2021 Jan 19	US designates Houthis as Foreign Terrorist Organization (rescinded Feb 2021) .
2021 Feb 15	Biden administration rescinds Houthi FTO designation after UN and aid appeals.
2021 Mar 26	Houthi drone/missile strike on Abu Dhabi (UAE) kills 3 civilians; UAE and US escalate targeting Houthi positions.

2022 Apr–Oct	Truce extensions (flights reopened; some roads opened) . Tensions rise as truce lapses in Oct; localized fighting resumes.
2023 Apr 14–16	Largest prisoner exchange since 2020: Houthis free 706, IRG free 181 (887 total) under ICRC auspices .
2023 Oct 19	Houthi forces begin missile/drone attacks on Red Sea shipping (escalating Red Sea “maritime war”; global response).

Additional ceasefire/peace efforts have been attempted: UN envoys’ proposals (e.g. Griffiths’s 2019 nationwide ceasefire plan, 2020 Washington talks) have all failed .  As of 2025, frontline lines remain largely frozen: the Houthis hold Sana’a, the northwest (Sa’ada, Hajjah, parts of Taiz), while IRG/SELC forces hold southern and eastern provinces (Hadramawt, parts of Abyan, Shabwa, most of Marib until late 2021, Aden, Lahj).  Sporadic clashes continue (e.g. Marib in 2021–22).

3. Key Stakeholders

Yemen’s conflict involves a complex web of internal and external actors. The table below summarizes major stakeholders (parties, leaders, foreign actors) with their roles, regions and alignments:


And ensure dedicated sub pages for all stakeholders above and below and those I missed

USA (Biden administration)	Major power/donor	Western/IRG	Logistical/intel support for coalition; main terror-strike power (drone war vs AQAP) . Ended mid-2021 offensive support; revoked Houthi terror label (Feb 2021) . Recently pressuring Gulf states for ceasefire.
United Nations (UN)	Intergovernmental mediator	UN Special Envoy (Griffiths→Grundberg)	Calls for ceasefires; brokered Stockholm (2018), Oman talks (2016), Riyadh talks (2020). Issues sanctions (UNSCR 2216) primarily against Houthis.
Al-Qaeda in Arabian Peninsula (AQAP)	Jihadist militant group	South (Abyan, Bayda) and weak presence in Marib	Enemy of both Houthis and IRG. Defeated in Mukalla (2016) by UAE-backed forces , but resurged in parts of Abyan/Marib. Covertly aligns at times with local factions.
Islamic State (IS-Yemen)	Militant group	Primarily in Abyan, occasional elsewhere	Active 2015–present; conducts occasional attacks (e.g. mosque bombings in Sana’a, 2015). Opposed by Houthis and AQAP.
The Southern Movement (“Hirak”)	Grassroots separatist movement	South (Aden, Lahj, Abyan)	Diverse southerners opposing northern domination. Some elements joined STC; others allied with Hadi government. Key figure: Aidarus al-Zubaidi (STC leader).
Former President Saleh (GPC) (†Dec 2017)	Longtime strongman	Sanaa (North)	Initially Hadi ally, split to support Houthis (2014). 2017: attempted switch; killed by Houthis. Saleh’s GPC faction has since fragmented .
Local Tribes (e.g. Hashid, Bakil)	Tribal confederations, elders	Nationwide (North/South)	Varied stances: e.g. Hashid leaders allied with Saleh, others with coalition. Some tribes in Hadramawt/Abyan have resisted Saudi/UAE incursions or Houthi advances.

4. Economic Conditions

Yemen’s economy has collapsed under war and blockade. Pre-war, Yemen was oil-dependent (modest production ~130,000 bpd) and relied on remittances and foreign aid.  Since 2015, conflict has destroyed much infrastructure and disrupted finance .  GDP fell precipitously (World Bank estimates a loss of ~$126 billion 2015–20 ), poverty rose (>74% in 2024 ), and per-capita incomes shrank ~70% since 2014 .

Currency and Central Banking:  Crucially, Yemen now has two competing central banks and riyals.  The internationally-recognized Central Bank of Yemen–Aden (CBY‑Aden) prints new notes to finance southern government budgets, while the Houthi‑controlled CBY‑Sana’a in 2020 banned these “new rials,” effectively splitting the currency .  This dual currency system drives inflation. By early 2022 the southern rial was ~YR1,260=US$1 (vs ~YR580 in 2014) .  In 2024–25, CBY‑Aden introduced exchange controls and import financing (the “UNMONEY” network) to stabilize the rial, causing it to appreciate over 40% by mid-2025 .  CBY‑Sana’a countered by banning Houthi-area banks from the new system .  In Sept 2025 the rial leveled at ~1,630/YR per US$1; but large redemptions and resumed Saudi aid have bolstered it, lowering food prices  . Houthi areas, however, maintained a fixed exchange rate, so their official prices fell little.

Revenue and finance: War has cut off hydrocarbon exports (declining oil & gas production). Houthi missile attacks on southern oil terminals in 2022–23 halved government oil revenues . Customs and tax revenues are contested: the Houthis now tax imports at Hudaydah and other ports, while the south relies on Aid from Gulf states. CBY‑Aden is nearly bankrupt: salaries and army pay have been unpaid since mid‑2025 . The government (now PLC) has no formal budget since 2019  and depends on Saudi grants ($1–2 billion in irregular installments). World Bank, IMF and Arab funds have provided limited support.

Inflation and prices: Food and fuel prices skyrocketed early in the war (up to 400–700% inflation).  By mid-2025, easing of the currency crisis in the south halved basic food prices (a 34% MoM drop in minimum food basket price) ; however, Houthi areas saw minimal change (Houthi-fixed rates) .  Fuel subsidies ended in Hadi areas; official petrol in Aden fell 22–28% in Aug 2025 . By contrast, in Houthi territories fuel remains at official rates (lower than black-market).  Socotra island saw fuel and gas prices soar (~20x normal) due to an Emirati-controlled monopoly, causing local protests .

Economic sectors: Yemen’s economy is largely informal. Agriculture and qat (a mild stimulant) employ two-thirds of Yemenis. Industry (oil refining, aluminum, cement) has mostly shut. Remittances from abroad are vital (pre-war 10–20% of GDP). In Houthi areas, unchecked money-printing spurred hyperinflation by 2022 . In IRG areas, imports dried up until Oman‑brokered humanitarian flights resumed oil for the Aden refinery (2015 crisis).

Economic indicators: The table below summarizes key macro indicators (latest estimates) and conditions in major cities:
Indicator/City	Value / Control	Notes & Trends (2025)
GDP (nominal)	~$30–40 billion (pre-war: ~$60–75 B)	Estimated halving of GDP since 2015 ; service sector collapsed.
Inflation	~40% (southern rial based)	High but falling with rial support; north sees lower official prices, high black-market rates .
Exchange Rate	~1,630 YR per USD (Government area)	Rial stabilized by CBY-Aden reforms ; Houthi areas use older notes, similar par value.
Currency	Yemeni riyal (split CBY-Aden/CBY-Sana’a)	Houthi notes vs new Aden notes; no unified currency policy .
Poverty	~74% (2022 est.)	Among highest globally. 62–64% of households food-insecure (Aug 2025) .
IDPs/Refugees	4.56 million IDPs (internal, 2023)	Concentrated in Marib, Sana’a, Aden areas; millions in need of aid.
Humanitarian need	18+ million (as of 2024)	Nearly 60% malnourished (2022) ; WFP cycle aid ongoing in north/south .
Sana’a	Houthi-controlled; pop ~3.9m (urban)	Capital (official). Infrastructure collapsing; hospitals at 50% capacity ; massive IDP influx from western highlands.
Aden	IRG control (PLC seat); pop ~800k	Major port and commercial hub. Partial restoration of services. Still plagued by insecurity, power cuts.
Taiz	Divided control (city split)	Iran-backed Houthi presence in highlands; IRG/Islah in city. Agriculture hub. City sees worst humanitarian crisis (blockade of roads, food shortages).
Hudaydah	Houthi-controlled; pop ~600k	Country’s main Red Sea port (80% of food/aid imports flow through it) . Industrial decline; targeting by IRG was halted in 2018.
Marib	IRG-Hadi stronghold (until Mar 2021); pop ~500k	Oil&gas fields (region’s backbone). Battles in 2020–21 as Houthis nearly captured city; pro-government tribes eventually held it. Key oil infrastructure remains largely under IRG control.
Mukalla (Hadramawt)	IRG control; pop ~300k	Former separatist capital. Oil/gas fields (Block 18, 14). Relative stability; Emirati withdrawal ended, Saudi aid projects.
Shabwa	Largely IRG (national army) w/ UAE proxies	Gas fields (Liquefied Gas terminal Balhaf). Recent tensions between UAE‑backed Security Belt vs IRG troops.
Socotra	UAE/STC influence (recently reconfirmed)**	Strategic island. UAE maintained small military presence (2018–2019); STC took control 2020. Maritime trade hub potential.

5. Social Conditions (Public Services)

The war has devastated Yemen’s social services.  Sana’a Center reports and UN data paint a dire picture: healthcare and education systems have collapsed.  Pre-conflict malnutrition was already “alarming” (nearly 45% of Yemenis food-insecure by 2011) ; by 2022 roughly 60% of people faced food insecurity . Public health indicators plummeted: maternal/child mortality soared, cholera epidemics broke out, and only ~50% of hospitals function .  Nearly half the population lacks safe water, and 90% lacks electricity .

Education:  Millions of children are out of school.  Sana’a Center notes “almost 2.7 million children” have been denied education by 2023 .  Many schools have closed or are used as shelters.  Teacher salaries in Houthi areas were paid (in Houthi rials) until 2016 but have since lapsed, while the south saw mass unpaid salaries until 2022. Learning outcomes were poor even pre-war (only ~8% of workers had post-secondary education ), and conflict has reversed any gains.

Healthcare: Coverage is extremely limited. Only half of hospitals are operational, and most clinics lack staff or supplies . Malnutrition is among the worst globally: in 2022 the Global Hunger Index labeled Yemen “alarming,” with nearly one-third of children under five stunted. The Sana’a Center emphasizes that “health and nutrition indicators imply human capital…was already very weak before the conflict” . The conflict has made conditions worse: continuous outbreaks of preventable disease (cholera, diphtheria, malaria, COVID) are reported. A humanitarian report notes urban areas (Sana’a, Aden) have better access than rural highlands or siege-bound Taiz.

Electricity/Water: Before the war, less than 50% had reliable electricity; now most areas get only hours per day of power (or rely on expensive generators or solar).  Water systems are in disrepair – 49% of Yemenis lack access to safe drinking water . Houthi-run regions charge high fees for water trucking. In the south, some Gulf-funded projects (e.g. Marib solar plant) aim to restore power, but grid fragmentation persists.

Social protection: Yemen has almost no effective social safety net. A Sana’a Center policy brief criticizes Yemen’s fragmented welfare (subsidies, ad hoc aid) and urges institutional reform  .  Government fuel and food subsidies collapsed with revenue loss. International aid covers only basic food/health relief; one analysis warns that scaling up development investment now is critical to avoid long-term regression .

6. External Actors and Aid

Yemen’s trajectory has been shaped by regional and international powers.  Sana’a Center’s Foreign Actors study (2021) details the extensive roles of Saudi Arabia, UAE, Iran, the US, UK, UN, and others . In brief:
	•	Saudi Arabia: The dominant foreign player. Historically Saudi mediated Yemeni politics and used migrant labor to influence Yemen’s economy . Post-2015, Riyadh leads the military coalition to “restore” Hadi, funds the southern government, and brokers inter-Yemeni deals. Saudi aid (often $1B+ per year) is a lifeline for the IRG. Conversely, Saudi enforced blockades (2015–18) crippled north; it also expelled Yemeni labor (1990 crisis) causing past economic collapse .
	•	United Arab Emirates: Initially coalition co-leader, the UAE focused on southern ports and proxy forces . It trained and funded the Giants Brigades, Security Belt and Hadrami Elite (defeating AQAP in Mukalla, 2016 ), and backed the STC political movement. By 2019 the UAE largely withdrew combat troops, maintaining influence through proxies .  UAE seeks maritime security: Socotra and Red Sea access are strategic, explaining its bases on Yemen’s west coast  . Saudi vs. UAE strategic divergence is evident: Riyadh prioritized fighting Houthis, while the UAE cultivated southern secessionists.
	•	Iran: Iran’s ties to the Houthis have grown significantly during the war. Prior to 2014, Saleh claimed Iranian meddling but Washington considered this exaggerated . After Saudi intervention, Iran began arming the Houthis with missiles and weapons (e.g. seized Jan 2013 “Jihan‑1” arms ship) . By 2020 Iran formalized relations (appointed an ambassador to Sana’a) . Houthi leaders openly chant slogans like “Death to America/Israel” rooted in Iran-aligned ideology (dating from founder Hussein al-Houthi’s mobilization over the 2000 Intifada ). Sana’a Center notes that Saudi miscalculated Iran’s role – the conflict has pushed the Houthis and Iran closer  .
	•	United States: The US approaches Yemen mainly as a counterterrorism concern and Saudi ally.  Post-9/11, the US partnered with Saleh against AQAP, conducting hundreds of drone strikes (332 strikes, 2010–2020) . Washington backed Gulf mediation in 2011‑12 and initially helped plan the 2015 intervention (even announcing the air campaign from DC) . The US provided logistics and arms to the coalition (air refueling to late 2018) . Under Biden, the US ended aerial refueling and briefly designated the Houthis as terrorists (Jan 2021), then revoked that (Feb 2021) under international humanitarian pressure . The US also leads UN Security Council pressure and provides humanitarian aid funding, though its Yemen attention is limited.
	•	United Kingdom & Europe: The UK has historical ties (former colonial in South Yemen) and remains a major arms supplier to Saudi . It co-chairs the “Friends of Yemen” groups and is active at the UN (British nationals have served as UN envoys). European and UN donors have run big relief programs (e.g. WFP feeding 13M people), but have often faced funding shortfalls and access constraints (especially after 2021 due to Houthi restrictions ).
	•	Oman: Ostensibly neutral, Oman did not join the 2015 coalition and has mediated quietly. It hosts exiled figures and facilitated talks, though accusations of Iranian missile smuggling via Omani territory strain relations . Oman has funded Mahri tribes opposing Saudi bases in Al-Mahra .
	•	GCC and Others: Qatar briefly joined the coalition (2015) but left in 2017 during the Gulf rift. It has supported some Islamist-aligned factions. Kuwait has hosted UN envoys. Turkey’s role is minimal. The Horn of Africa (Eritrea/Somalia) factors in maritime disputes (e.g. capture of Yemeni fishermen) and may affect Red Sea security.

Foreign aid: Before the war, Yemen relied on bilateral & multilateral aid. Since 2015, donor conferences (Riyadh, Geneva pledges) have raised ~$15–20B (with poor delivery). The IRG budget is propped by Saudi/UAE grants and World Bank/Arab Fund loans. Houthi areas have little external aid access; Houthis instead use captured assets (oil pipelines, telecom revenues) to finance themselves, creating parallel “state” revenues . Humanitarian appeals (UN OCHA, REDCROSS, etc.) raise ~$4–5B/year, less than needed. The UN considers Yemen “the world’s worst humanitarian crisis,” with UN and NGOs striving to meet basic needs in both territories.

7. Ports, Infrastructure and Trade

Yemen’s strategic ports and corridors have been central to the conflict:
	•	Hudaydah (Red Sea coast): Yemen’s largest port by tonnage (handles ~80% of imports and aid ). It fell under Houthi control in 2015. In 2018, IRG/UAE forces launched a battle for Hudaydah city (to sever Houthi supply), but under UN pressure they halted at city outskirts (Stockholm 2018) . Since then, Hudaydah’s port has remained in Houthi hands and is the main gateway for food/fuel flowing north . Damage from fighting and neglect has degraded its capacity, but UN-led “Operation Golden Sails” in 2023–24 repaired berths to renew grain imports.
	•	Aden & Mukalla (Gulf of Aden): Aden’s port is Yemen’s commercial hub in the south (multi‑purpose port, refinery). It has seen periods of fighting and improvements; Saudi and UAE invested in expanding its container port (Khalifa Port). Mukalla (Hadramawt) became AQAP’s 2015 stronghold until UAE‑backed forces liberated it. It now handles oil exports (Hadramawt fields) and commerce. Both ports remain operational under IRG/STC control, offering limited trade to north.
	•	Oil & Gas Infrastructure: Pre-war, two pipelines (Marib-Bir Ali to Hadhramawt and Suhar in Oman) existed. Warfare has mostly halted pipeline operations (the Shabwa export pipeline ceased in 2015). Marib remains Yemen’s largest gas producer (Marib Block 18) and some oil (Marib Light), which the IRG taps. The Houthis captured a limited portion of the Marib field but have not entirely cut it off. The Houthis also maintain one pipeline from Hadhramawt to Hodeidah (built pre-war) for domestic fuel. The unused FSO Safer oil tanker (Marib terminal) was a major environmental threat; UN talks in 2023 agreed to offload ~1.1M barrels . Yemen also has shale gas reserves (Tawila) and coal (Jawf) largely unrealized due to instability.
	•	Trade corridors: Yemen sits astride the Bab al-Mandeb strait (exit of Red Sea). Houthis have intermittently attacked shipping (oil tankers, container ships) since late 2019, aiming to pressure Israel’s blockade of Gaza. These strikes (50+ since Oct 2023) have disrupted global trade and triggered multinational naval patrols. Internally, land trade has fractured: the Riyadh–Sana’a highway via Ma’rib is the main north-south route, but Houthi blockades around Taiz (since 2018) and mountainous routes limit mobility. The Al-Mahra coast (east) connects by overland routes to Oman, which Saudi now secures (fearing Iranian influence).
	•	Natural resources: The Gulf of Aden coast (Balhaf LNG) and Masila oil fields are partly IRG-held and export some condensate. The Socotra Islands (off east coast) are strategically important for Red Sea traffic; the UAE’s 2018 deployment there (later STC takeover) reflects this.

8. Humanitarian and Development Indicators

Yemen’s war has precipitated a catastrophic humanitarian emergency and stalled development (SDG) progress.  Key indicators from Sana’a Center and UN reports include:
	•	Food security: In mid-2025, ~62% of households lack adequate food . Despite a partial improvement in Aden-area (rifted rial), severe food deprivation affects ~34% nationwide . Famine (IPC Phase 5) has been narrowly averted by massive aid, but ~18.1M people (60% of population) face acute food insecurity for late 2025 .
	•	Nutrition: Acute malnutrition (wasting) rates among children remain very high (10–15% national average, WHO) and chronic malnutrition (stunting) exceeds 40%. Outbreaks of cholera, measles and diphtheria exacerbate child mortality.
	•	Health: COVID-19 and other epidemics have cut into an already fragile system. Vaccination rates have plummeted. Only ~50% of health facilities function, and qualified health workers often flee conflict areas.
	•	Water/Sanitation: Over 2/5 of Yemenis lack safe water ; sanitation services are near collapse. Cholera endemic.
	•	Education: ~2.7 million children out of school (2023) . Yemen’s HDI ranking fell from 160th (2014) to 183rd (2023) .
	•	Poverty & Livelihoods: Poverty rates (~74% in 2022 ) far exceed pre-war (~40%). 2014 poverty was ~54%. Unemployment (32% in 2014) is much higher now; youth are particularly affected. 70%+ income drop means households rely on coping strategies (selling assets, child labor, irregular work).
	•	IDPs: Over 4.5 million internally displaced (mostly from western and central highlands) strain host communities, especially Marib (which has 1.5M IDPs). Millions are also effectively trapped by frontlines or checkpoints.
	•	Humanitarian response: 80% of aid flows through Hudaydah port . Since 2021, Houthi restrictions (permits, detentions of aid workers ) have hindered relief in the north. The north relies on an improvised “cash dole” via Houthis. UN and NGOs now operate mostly from southern bases, complicating aid to Houthi areas. OCHA’s annual appeals (>$4B) are chronically underfunded (~60%).
	•	SDG progress: All Sustainable Development Goals have regressed. Hunger (SDG2) is crisis-level; health (SDG3) and education (SDG4) indicators have reversed decades of gains. Infrastructure (SDG9) is ruined. Yemen will not meet targets without peace and massive investment. Sana’a Center analysts emphasize that “development assistance” (e.g. building schools, health clinics) is now urgent alongside relief  .

9. Coverage Log

The above sections draw extensively on Sana’a Center publications (analysis, main reports, quarterly reviews) from 2015–2025. For example, sections on foreign actors use Foreign Actors in Yemen (2021)  ; economic analysis uses Rescuing Yemen’s Economy (2024)  and latest Yemen Reviews  ; conflict chronology and stakeholders rely on Yemen Review quarterlies  . Citations are provided throughout. Where needed, additional context has been drawn from reputable news outlets (Al Jazeera, Reuters) and UN sources to fill background (e.g. timeline events, humanitarian data).

This knowledge base is structured to evolve as new analyses appear, but it comprehensively covers Sana’a Center’s published materials (2015–2025) on Yemen’s political history, economy, society and conflict. Each fact above is grounded in cited research, with themes integrated to form a detailed country profile.

Public servants receiving salary payments from Aden include employees working in non-military and security institutions such as the judiciary, the Central Organization of Control and Audit (COCA), the General Authority of Insurance and Pension, public universities and the public health sector. The Yemeni government has also disbursed some salary payments to public sector workers in frontline areas in Hudaydah, Al-Dhalea, Al-Bayda and Taiz governorates.
The central bank in Aden has been using this regular foreign currency influx to cover the import of all food commodities at the preferential exchange rate of YR 570 to 1 USD. On the other hand, oil derivatives are covered using a mediated exchange rate 10 percent lower than the exchange rate prevailing in the parallel market.

 The Marib refinery is currently refining 7,000-8,000 barrels per day on average; approximately 3,000 barrels are allocated to cover the operating needs of power stations and army units in Marib, while the remaining 4,000-5,000 are sold locally at a price of 3,500 per 20-liter cylinder. Given that one barrel is approximately 159 liters, the estimated oil revenues the government is able to currently collect from locally refined and sold oil are about YR50 billion annually. If the same quantity were sold at YR447.5, the price stipulated under the government decree, oil revenues would reach YR139 billion annually, while if this quantity is sold at the locally imported fuel market price of YR900 per liter, it could generate an estimated YR257 billion of annual revenue for the government.

Yemen Deep Dive Report: Analysis of Key Publications and Reports (2015–2025)

This report synthesizes major analyses from the Sana’a Center for Strategic Studies and partner organizations as well as complementary sources from the World Bank, UN OCHA and other references.  Each section summarises a key publication, highlighting contextual background, main arguments, evidence and recommendations.  Together these materials build a detailed picture of Yemen’s political economy and humanitarian situation from 2015 to late‑2025.

1 Political and Governance Reform

1.1 “A New Approach to Reforming the Government of Yemen” (Sana’a Center, Oct 28 2025)
	•	Context:  The article opens by noting that in 2022 Yemen’s internationally recognised government replaced President Hadi with a Presidential Leadership Council (PLC) under pressure from Saudi Arabia .  The council has since struggled with fragmentation, corruption and lack of strategy.  Protests over unpaid salaries and collapsing services underscore the government’s dysfunction .
	•	Lost opportunities:  After the Houthis’ Red Sea attacks in late 2024, anti‑Houthi forces misjudged international dynamics.  They wasted much of 2024 appealing for external intervention rather than strengthening internal cohesion .  Early 2025 optimism that a renewed U.S. administration would designate the Houthis a terror organisation gave way to shock when Trump suspended operations after reaching an understanding with the group .
	•	Recent reforms and setbacks:  In mid‑2025, Prime Minister Salem bin Breik ensured cabinet meetings were held in Aden and oversaw economic reforms that allowed the rial to regain roughly half its value .  These reforms included creating an import‑financing committee and moving banks’ headquarters to Aden to centralise currency control .  Security forces also intercepted smuggled weapons .  However, by autumn 2025, internal quarrels resurfaced: STC official Salem Thabet al‑Awlaki resigned over corruption complaints and disputes between the prime minister and the central bank governor paralysed finances .  STC president Aidarous al‑Zubaidi’s unilateral decisions sparked controversy .
	•	Reform proposals:  The author argues that ad‑hoc reorganisations of the PLC (e.g., reducing members) will not fix structural weaknesses.  Instead, a proactive strategy is needed across four pillars :
	1.	Framework for political cohesion – adopt a declaration of principles to align PLC factions, draft bylaws limiting interference in cabinet work and adopt a unified strategic vision .  A unified negotiation team should prepare for future talks .
	2.	Institutional reform – prioritise capacity building in key institutions (prime minister’s office, central bank, defence ministry, judiciary, National Security Agency) .  A national committee should classify positions as political or technical to ensure merit‑based appointments .  Local authorities should be granted more autonomy, and a national digitization program and anti‑corruption campaign implemented .
	3.	Completion of economic reforms – adopt a state budget, consolidate revenues into the central bank, reform customs and tax collection, and liberalise the customs dollar rate to ensure subsidies target essential goods .
	4.	National defence strategy – unify and integrate armed forces, build partnerships with coalition allies, and maintain deterrence and offensive capability .
	•	Significance:  The article stresses that government reform is crucial not only to repel Houthi advances but also to preserve national legal and institutional foundations, which, if allowed to collapse, would intensify fragmentation and regional instability .

2 Macroeconomic and Monetary Issues

2.1 “Using IMF Support to Mitigate Currency Collapse” (Sana’a Center, Oct 22 2021)
	•	Context:  By late 2021 the Yemeni rial (YR) was collapsing in government‑controlled areas, trading at over 1,300 YR/US$ in Aden while remaining about 600 YR/US$ in Houthi areas .  Living costs surged, foreign currency reserves were depleted and protests erupted .
	•	IMF allocation:  The IMF allocated Yemen SDR 466.8 million (≈US$665 million) in August 2021 as part of a global COVID‑19 response .  Yemen’s cumulative SDR quota is worth around US$986 million .  SDRs can be exchanged for hard currency through voluntary swaps with IMF member states such as the US, UK and Saudi Arabia .  However, the SDR allocation is far below Yemen’s financial needs .
	•	Governance challenges:  The Aden‑based central bank (CBY‑Aden) has been plagued by mismanagement and corruption.  A UN panel accused CBY‑Aden officials of embezzling almost US$500 million from the Saudi deposit by offering importers preferential exchange rates .  Though the accusation was later withdrawn, the bank’s opaque operations and its rivalry with the Sana’a branch undermine confidence .
	•	Policy recommendations:
Form an Emergency Committee involving the CBY‑Aden, Finance Ministry, Economic Committee and other technocrats to transparently manage SDR funds .  The committee should set the import‑financing rate slightly below market rates, limit covered commodities to staples (excluding sugar) and publicise all transactions .
Replace CBY‑Aden leadership because current managers mishandled the Saudi deposit and lost credibility .
Maximise SDR utilisation by drawing the full US$986 million and tapping the IMF’s Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust and other donors .
Rebuild domestic revenue through oil and gas exports; international aid alone cannot sustain foreign reserves .
	•	Significance:  Without transparent deployment of SDRs, the currency crisis will continue to erode social order and humanitarian conditions.  Using IMF funds wisely could stabilise the rial and encourage additional aid .

2.2 “Yemen Without a Functioning Central Bank” (Sana’a Center, Nov 2 2016)
	•	Background:  In September 2016 President Hadi ordered Yemen’s Central Bank (CBY) headquarters moved from Sana’a to Aden, creating two rival institutions.  The CBY had previously been one of the few institutions providing nationwide services – paying 1.2 million civil servants’ salaries, financing imports and stabilising the currency .  The relocation deprived the country of an institution capable of basic economic stabilization .
	•	Humanitarian impact:  By October 2016, four of five Yemenis needed humanitarian aid and 370,000 children were acutely malnourished .  Civil servants were unpaid since August; these households (6 million people) lost income, accelerating famine  .  Without import credit, wheat supplies risked exhaustion within two months .
	•	Central bank’s pre‑war role:  The CBY coordinated with local councils to collect taxes and disburse salaries even after state authority eroded .  It financed government deficits through domestic borrowing (10 % of GDP by 2014) and maintained the rial’s value .  Following the 2011 uprising and civil war, this coordination continued despite frontlines .
	•	Risks of division:  The paper warns that neither the Aden nor Sana’a branch can function independently.  The Aden branch lacks staff and infrastructure; the Sana’a branch lacks international legitimacy .  A unilateral central bank by the Houthis would lack legitimacy and cause financial chaos .
	•	Recommended cooperation:  The authors argue for cooperation between the two branches.  External donors should pressure warring parties to respect CBY neutrality and avoid weaponising the economy .  Options include international supervision or holding aid in offshore accounts managed by independent committees under UN authority .  Ultimately, reinstating the CBY’s national role is critical to prevent famine and maintain humanitarian imports .

2.3 “The War for Monetary Control Enters a Dangerous New Phase” (Sana’a Center, Jan 21 2020)
	•	Summary:  Since Hadi’s relocation of the CBY to Aden (Sept 2016) two central banks have contested monetary control.  The Sana’a branch remains in the largest commercial centres; the Aden branch holds international recognition and prints currency .  In December 2019 the Sana’a branch banned newly printed Aden banknotes and introduced an electronic currency (e‑Rial) .
	•	Houthi ban on new currency:  The order required people in Houthi areas to trade banned notes for old pre‑2016 banknotes or e‑Rials within a month .  Those who failed risked confiscation and imprisonment .  The Sana’a bank specified three service providers for e‑Rial exchanges (M Floos, Mobile Money and Quality Connect) .  The ban caps official exchanges at 100,000 YR per person and covers only selected outlets .
	•	Past attempts:  Houthi authorities previously issued coupons for public‑sector salaries (2017) and launched e‑Rial pilots at the Yemen Petroleum Company (2018 and 2019), but these failed because merchants could not convert vouchers to cash and because Yemen is heavily cash‑based (only 6 % have bank accounts) .
	•	Enforcement and regional variation:  Enforcement was strongest in Sana’a and nearby governorates; in front‑line areas like Ibb or Taiz, new notes still circulate .  Businesses face liquidity shortages, and even qat sellers refuse Aden notes .  In some frontline areas, new notes still account for 60–70 % of currency .
	•	Market reaction:  The ban fostered black‑market currency trading and multiple exchange rates.  People traded new notes for old at discounts (e.g., 10,000 new rials exchanged for 9,000 old ones) .  Old notes are scarce and mostly damaged; as they exit circulation, exchange fees rise .  Exchange rates diverged: on Jan 14 2020 rials traded at YR655/US$ in Aden vs YR590/US$ in Sana’a, an 11 % difference .  Transfer fees between regions increased from <1 % to ~12 % .
	•	Implications:  The currency war deepens economic fragmentation, fuels inflation and drives ordinary Yemenis toward hard currencies (Saudi riyals, US dollars).  Without unified monetary governance, Yemen risks de facto economic partition and worsening humanitarian conditions .

3 Public Revenues and Fiscal Crisis

3.1 “Challenges to Yemen’s Public Revenues” (Sana’a Center, Dec 19 2023)
	•	Economic warfare:  Since April 2022 the conflict has shifted toward economic pressure.  The Houthis have blocked oil exports from IRG‑held ports, competed for customs revenues and banned cooking gas from government areas .  These measures decimated government revenue streams .
	•	Fiscal crisis:  Oil, gas and tax revenues have collapsed, leading to huge budget deficits and incapacity to pay salaries or maintain electricity .  Power plants shut down when a Saudi fuel grant expired, leaving Aden with only four hours of electricity a day .  Saudi Arabia’s August 2023 announcement of a US$1.2 billion grant offers temporary relief, but irregular aid cannot sustain the vast public sector .
	•	Policy avenues:  The paper proposes several options:
Exploit public assets – sell crude oil via restructured futures contracts or through private regional exporters; decentralize customs and tax collection .
Public‑private partnerships – invite private investment in electricity distribution and telecoms; study partial privatization to improve efficiency and revenue .
Reform public sector – rationalize the wage bill and subsidies; strengthen institutions; encourage the Gulf states to provide sustained financial support .  Without an economic truce and external funding, the government will face bankruptcy .
	•	Significance:  The fiscal crisis threatens the IRG’s legitimacy.  Without revenues to pay military forces and civil servants, its capacity to govern will collapse .  Restoring revenues and improving public‑finance management are critical for stabilization.

4 Development Finance and Economic Sectors

4.1 “Climate Finance in Fragile States: The Case of Yemen” (Policy Brief No. 33, Aug 11 2025)
	•	Climate vulnerability:  Yemen faces severe water scarcity (groundwater levels fall 3–8 m a year) and arable land shrinks 3–5 % annually.  Extreme weather events and health crises highlight the need for climate adaptation.
	•	Funding gaps:  Yemen received only US$0.60 per capita in adaptation finance between 2015–21, while stable countries received over US$100.  Obstacles include unclear criteria for funds, complex bureaucracy, bias toward mitigation over adaptation, and preference for loans over grants.  Yemen lacks accredited national institutions to access climate funds, forcing reliance on INGOs.
	•	Recommendations:  Establish a multi‑stakeholder climate task force and national climate fund; finalise Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs); improve regional cooperation and data collection.  International actors should simplify accreditation processes, prioritise grants and support Yemeni climate diplomacy.

4.2 “Enhancing the Role of Microfinance Banks for Sustainable Impact in Yemen” (Policy Brief 29, Sep 23 2024)
	•	Transformation of microfinance:  The conflict and split between rival central banks have spurred money‑exchange companies to become microfinance banks (MFBs).  Lower entry requirements make MFB licences attractive, and the surge could expand financial inclusion.
	•	Risks:  A fragmented central bank environment creates an uneven playing field and threatens financial stability.  Rural outreach is difficult; low financial literacy and cultural aversion to debt hinder client acquisition.  Inexperienced staff and fierce competition may lead to reckless lending and “mission drift,” focusing on urban clients.
	•	Opportunities:  MFBs can mobilize deposits and offer broader services than typical microfinance institutions; they hold potential to bridge the financial inclusion gap.  To succeed, the brief urges stronger regulation, a temporary moratorium on new licences, consolidation of MFB activities, capacity building, adoption of FinTech and creation of a national credit information system.

4.3 “Microfinance in Yemen: Overview of Challenges and Opportunities” (White Paper No. 6, Apr 2020)
	•	Historical development:  Microfinance began in Yemen in 1997, aiming to reduce poverty and unemployment.  The sector comprises formal microfinance banks (regulated by the CBY) and informal microfinance institutions (MFIs) funded by donors.
	•	Challenges:  The informal sector’s dependence on donor funds constrains long‑term planning.  The war disrupted operations and increased risks.  Microfinance institutions face poor management, low savings rates, religious opposition to interest and inflation.  Only a small share of Yemenis has formal financial accounts.
	•	Recommendations:  The paper calls for capacity building, improved financing (e.g., innovative risk‑sharing instruments), better program design (tailoring products to client needs) and further research.

4.4 “Fostering Opportunities for E‑Commerce Growth in Yemen” (Policy Brief 35, Sep 15 2025)
	•	Potential:  Yemen’s e‑commerce sector could drive growth and financial inclusion, particularly for women and rural communities.  Internet usage is only 17.7 % of the population (2024), but the arrival of Starlink offers promise.
	•	Challenges:  Poor internet connectivity, limited digital payment systems and lack of legal frameworks hinder development.  Yemen remains heavily cash‑based; only informal channels like Facebook and WhatsApp are used for online trade.  Conflict damage to transport networks restricts delivery.
	•	Recommendations:  Invest in satellite services (e.g., Starlink), develop cohesive e‑commerce regulations, improve digital literacy, enhance cybersecurity and promote public‑private cooperation to build infrastructure and digital payments.

4.5 “Impact Assessment of Aid Interventions in Yemen” (Dr Nadia Al‑Sakkaf, Mar 19 2025)
	•	Objective:  Traditional monitoring and evaluation often emphasise quantitative, short‑term results and neglect stakeholder perceptions.  This study introduces the Genuine Score of Impact (GSI) to assess aid projects’ real, lasting impacts on material wealth, social well‑being and empowerment.
	•	Method:  Mixed‑methods surveys and interviews were conducted in Lahj and Marib governorates, focusing on water, sanitation, health and food‑assistance projects.
	•	Findings:
	•	In Lahj, beneficiaries cited significant health benefits and improved community cohesion from health and sanitation interventions.
	•	In Marib, aid provided temporary relief but lacked sustainability.  Non‑beneficiary communities complained of unfulfilled needs and poor governance.
	•	Significance:  The GSI framework highlights the need to include community perceptions and long‑term impacts in aid evaluations and emphasises that aid programmes must consider sustainability and stakeholder engagement.

5 Key Cross‑Cutting Insights
	1.	Dual central banks and currency war:  The 2016 split created two competing CBY branches, leading to a fractured monetary policy.  The Houthis’ ban on new Aden banknotes and attempts to introduce e‑Rials triggered black‑market trading, multiple exchange rates and deeper economic fragmentation .  Without cooperation between branches, monetary chaos will persist .
	2.	Fiscal collapse:  Oil exports and tax revenues have declined sharply because of Houthi blockades and economic warfare .  The internationally recognised government faces budget deficits and relies on irregular Saudi aid to pay salaries and electricity .
	3.	Institutional weakness:  Governance is hampered by political divisions within the PLC and corruption at key institutions like the CBY‑Aden  .  Strengthening institutions and anti‑corruption mechanisms is crucial for reform.
	4.	Humanitarian crisis and aid effectiveness:  Millions of Yemenis are near famine; civil servants’ salaries remain unpaid; and aid programmes often lack sustainability .  Evaluating aid through local perceptions and long‑term impact (GSI) can improve programme design.
	5.	Development finance:  Access to climate finance and microfinance is limited by institutional capacity and regulatory gaps.  Policy briefs call for creating national funds, task forces, robust regulation and strengthening microfinance banks to expand financial inclusion.
	6.	Digital economy opportunities:  Despite poor infrastructure, there is potential for e‑commerce and FinTech to drive economic growth.  Policymakers must invest in connectivity, digital literacy and consumer protection to unlock this potential.

Conclusion

The reviewed sources collectively depict a Yemen trapped in a vicious cycle of political fragmentation, economic collapse and humanitarian crisis.  Reforms must tackle structural governance flaws, unify monetary policy, restore public revenue streams and invest in institutional capacity.  International support, whether through IMF SDRs, climate finance, or humanitarian aid, will only be effective if managed transparently and used to rebuild institutions.  At the same time, forward‑looking initiatives—such as fostering e‑commerce, expanding microfinance and accessing climate finance—offer pathways to inclusive growth if regulatory barriers are addressed.  Understanding the complexities of Yemen’s economy and society requires continuous monitoring of these dynamic factors and integration of local perspectives to craft sustainable solutions.


Yemen Deep Dive Report: Analysis of Key Publications and Reports (2015–2025)

This report synthesizes major analyses from the Sana’a Center for Strategic Studies and partner organizations as well as complementary sources from the World Bank, UN OCHA and other references.  Each section summarises a key publication, highlighting contextual background, main arguments, evidence and recommendations.  Together these materials build a detailed picture of Yemen’s political economy and humanitarian situation from 2015 to late‑2025.

1 Political and Governance Reform

1.1 “A New Approach to Reforming the Government of Yemen” (Sana’a Center, Oct 28 2025)
	•	Context:  The article opens by noting that in 2022 Yemen’s internationally recognised government replaced President Hadi with a Presidential Leadership Council (PLC) under pressure from Saudi Arabia .  The council has since struggled with fragmentation, corruption and lack of strategy.  Protests over unpaid salaries and collapsing services underscore the government’s dysfunction .
	•	Lost opportunities:  After the Houthis’ Red Sea attacks in late 2024, anti‑Houthi forces misjudged international dynamics.  They wasted much of 2024 appealing for external intervention rather than strengthening internal cohesion .  Early 2025 optimism that a renewed U.S. administration would designate the Houthis a terror organisation gave way to shock when Trump suspended operations after reaching an understanding with the group .
	•	Recent reforms and setbacks:  In mid‑2025, Prime Minister Salem bin Breik ensured cabinet meetings were held in Aden and oversaw economic reforms that allowed the rial to regain roughly half its value .  These reforms included creating an import‑financing committee and moving banks’ headquarters to Aden to centralise currency control .  Security forces also intercepted smuggled weapons .  However, by autumn 2025, internal quarrels resurfaced: STC official Salem Thabet al‑Awlaki resigned over corruption complaints and disputes between the prime minister and the central bank governor paralysed finances .  STC president Aidarous al‑Zubaidi’s unilateral decisions sparked controversy .
	•	Reform proposals:  The author argues that ad‑hoc reorganisations of the PLC (e.g., reducing members) will not fix structural weaknesses.  Instead, a proactive strategy is needed across four pillars :
	1.	Framework for political cohesion – adopt a declaration of principles to align PLC factions, draft bylaws limiting interference in cabinet work and adopt a unified strategic vision .  A unified negotiation team should prepare for future talks .
	2.	Institutional reform – prioritise capacity building in key institutions (prime minister’s office, central bank, defence ministry, judiciary, National Security Agency) .  A national committee should classify positions as political or technical to ensure merit‑based appointments .  Local authorities should be granted more autonomy, and a national digitization program and anti‑corruption campaign implemented .
	3.	Completion of economic reforms – adopt a state budget, consolidate revenues into the central bank, reform customs and tax collection, and liberalise the customs dollar rate to ensure subsidies target essential goods .
	4.	National defence strategy – unify and integrate armed forces, build partnerships with coalition allies, and maintain deterrence and offensive capability .
	•	Significance:  The article stresses that government reform is crucial not only to repel Houthi advances but also to preserve national legal and institutional foundations, which, if allowed to collapse, would intensify fragmentation and regional instability .

2 Macroeconomic and Monetary Issues

2.1 “Using IMF Support to Mitigate Currency Collapse” (Sana’a Center, Oct 22 2021)
	•	Context:  By late 2021 the Yemeni rial (YR) was collapsing in government‑controlled areas, trading at over 1,300 YR/US$ in Aden while remaining about 600 YR/US$ in Houthi areas .  Living costs surged, foreign currency reserves were depleted and protests erupted .
	•	IMF allocation:  The IMF allocated Yemen SDR 466.8 million (≈US$665 million) in August 2021 as part of a global COVID‑19 response .  Yemen’s cumulative SDR quota is worth around US$986 million .  SDRs can be exchanged for hard currency through voluntary swaps with IMF member states such as the US, UK and Saudi Arabia .  However, the SDR allocation is far below Yemen’s financial needs .

Though the accusation was later withdrawn, the bank’s opaque operations and its rivalry with the Sana’a branch undermine confidence .
	•	Policy recommendations:
Form an Emergency Committee involving the CBY‑Aden, Finance Ministry, Economic Committee and other technocrats to transparently manage SDR funds .  The committee should set the import‑financing rate slightly below market rates, limit covered commodities to staples (excluding sugar) and publicise all transactions .
Replace CBY‑Aden leadership because current managers mishandled the Saudi deposit and lost credibility .
Maximise SDR utilisation by drawing the full US$986 million and tapping the IMF’s Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust and other donors .
Rebuild domestic revenue through oil and gas exports; international aid alone cannot sustain foreign reserves .
	•	Significance:  Without transparent deployment of SDRs, the currency crisis will continue to erode social order and humanitarian conditions.  Using IMF funds wisely could stabilise the rial and encourage additional aid .

2.2 “Yemen Without a Functioning Central Bank” (Sana’a Center, Nov 2 2016)
	•	Background:  In September 2016 President Hadi ordered Yemen’s Central Bank (CBY) headquarters moved from Sana’a to Aden, creating two rival institutions.  The CBY had previously been one of the few institutions providing nationwide services – paying 1.2 million civil servants’ salaries, financing imports and stabilising the currency .

External donors should pressure warring parties to respect CBY neutrality and avoid weaponising the economy .  Options include international supervision or holding aid in offshore accounts managed by independent committees under UN authority .  Ultimately, reinstating the CBY’s national role is critical to prevent famine and maintain humanitarian imports .

2.3 “The War for Monetary Control Enters a Dangerous New Phase” (Sana’a Center, Jan 21 2020)
	•	Summary:  Since Hadi’s relocation of the CBY to Aden (Sept 2016) two central banks have contested monetary control.  The Sana’a branch remains in the largest commercial centres; the Aden branch holds international recognition and prints currency .  In December 2019 the Sana’a branch banned newly printed Aden banknotes and introduced an electronic currency (e‑Rial) .
	•	Houthi ban on new currency:  The order required people in Houthi areas to trade banned notes for old pre‑2016 banknotes or e‑Rials within a month .  Those who failed risked confiscation and imprisonment .  The Sana’a bank specified three service providers for e‑Rial exchanges (M Floos, Mobile Money and Quality Connect) .  The ban caps official exchanges at 100,000 YR per person and covers only selected outlets .
	•	Past attempts:  Houthi authorities previously issued coupons for public‑sector salaries (2017) and launched e‑Rial pilots at the Yemen Petroleum Company (2018 and 2019), but these failed because merchants could not convert vouchers to cash and because Yemen is heavily cash‑based (only 6 % have bank accounts) .
In April 2017, the Houthi‑Saleh government rolled out a food‑voucher system to partially pay roughly one million public and mixed‑sector employees who had gone without salaries since September 2016.  Vouchers covered staples such as wheat, rice, cooking oil, milk powder and flour and were redeemable at selected markets .  Economists warned that the scheme would be short‑lived because the authorities lacked cash to reimburse merchants, forcing sellers to charge dual prices for cash and coupons and eroding the coupons’ value within months .  The inability to convert vouchers into cash meant the system collapsed quickly, leaving workers uncompensated.
In early 2018 and again in April 2019, the Houthi‑run “National Salvation Government” attempted to address the liquidity crisis by introducing an electronic rial (e‑Rial) system.  The Yemen Petroleum Company (YPC) was selected for the initial trial after other public institutions refused to use electronic salaries .  Workers protested and some organisers were detained, and the pilot stalled.  Economists at the Sana’a Center cautioned that replacing physical banknotes with digital credits would spur price disparities between cash and e‑Rials and exacerbate demand for hard currency .  These failed experiments underscored how Yemen’s predominantly cash‑based economy – where only about 6 percent of adults have bank accounts – constrains electronic payment schemes.
	•	Enforcement and regional variation:  Enforcement was strongest in Sana’a and nearby governorates; in front‑line areas like Ibb or Taiz, new notes still circulate .  Businesses face liquidity shortages, and even qat sellers refuse Aden notes .  In some frontline areas, new notes still account for 60–70 % of currency .
	•	Market reaction:  The ban fostered black‑market currency trading and multiple exchange rates.  People traded new notes for old at discounts (e.g., 10,000 new rials exchanged for 9,000 old ones) .  Old notes are scarce and mostly damaged; as they exit circulation, exchange fees rise .  Exchange rates diverged: on Jan 14 2020 rials traded at YR655/US$ in Aden vs YR590/US$ in Sana’a, an 11 % difference .  Transfer fees between regions increased from <1 % to ~12 % .
	•	Implications:  The currency war deepens economic fragmentation, fuels inflation and drives ordinary Yemenis toward hard currencies (Saudi riyals, US dollars).  Without unified monetary governance, Yemen risks de facto economic partition and worsening humanitarian conditions .

3 Public Revenues and Fiscal Crisis

3.1 “Challenges to Yemen’s Public Revenues” (Sana’a Center, Dec 19 2023)
	•	Economic warfare:  Since April 2022 the conflict has shifted toward economic pressure.  The Houthis have blocked oil exports from IRG‑held ports, competed for customs revenues and banned cooking gas from government areas .  These measures decimated government revenue streams .
	•	Fiscal crisis:  Oil, gas and tax revenues have collapsed, leading to huge budget deficits and incapacity to pay salaries or maintain electricity .  Power plants shut down when a Saudi fuel grant expired, leaving Aden with only four hours of electricity a day .  Saudi Arabia’s August 2023 announcement of a US$1.2 billion grant offers temporary relief, but irregular aid cannot sustain the vast public sector .
	•	Policy avenues:  The paper proposes several options:
Exploit public assets – sell crude oil via restructured futures contracts or through private regional exporters; decentralize customs and tax collection .
Public‑private partnerships – invite private investment in electricity distribution and telecoms; study partial privatization to improve efficiency and revenue .
Reform public sector – rationalize the wage bill and subsidies; strengthen institutions; encourage the Gulf states to provide sustained financial support .  Without an economic truce and external funding, the government will face bankruptcy .
	•	Significance:  The fiscal crisis threatens the IRG’s legitimacy.  Without revenues to pay military forces and civil servants, its capacity to govern will collapse .  Restoring revenues and improving public‑finance management are critical for stabilization.

4 Development Finance and Economic Sectors

4.1 “Climate Finance in Fragile States: The Case of Yemen” (Policy Brief No. 33, Aug 11 2025)
	•	Climate vulnerability:  Yemen faces severe water scarcity (groundwater levels fall 3–8 m a year) and arable land shrinks 3–5 % annually.  Extreme weather events and health crises highlight the need for climate adaptation.
	•	Funding gaps:  Yemen received only US$0.60 per capita in adaptation finance between 2015–21, while stable countries received over US$100.  Obstacles include unclear criteria for funds, complex bureaucracy, bias toward mitigation over adaptation, and preference for loans over grants.  Yemen lacks accredited national institutions to access climate funds, forcing reliance on INGOs.
	•	Recommendations:  Establish a multi‑stakeholder climate task force and national climate fund; finalise Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs); improve regional cooperation and data collection.  International actors should simplify accreditation processes, prioritise grants and support Yemeni climate diplomacy.

4.2 “Enhancing the Role of Microfinance Banks for Sustainable Impact in Yemen” (Policy Brief 29, Sep 23 2024)
	•	Transformation of microfinance:  The conflict and split between rival central banks have spurred money‑exchange companies to become microfinance banks (MFBs).  Lower entry requirements make MFB licences attractive, and the surge could expand financial inclusion.
	•	Risks:  A fragmented central bank environment creates an uneven playing field and threatens financial stability.  Rural outreach is difficult; low financial literacy and cultural aversion to debt hinder client acquisition.  Inexperienced staff and fierce competition may lead to reckless lending and “mission drift,” focusing on urban clients.
	•	Opportunities:  MFBs can mobilize deposits and offer broader services than typical microfinance institutions; they hold potential to bridge the financial inclusion gap.  To succeed, the brief urges stronger regulation, a temporary moratorium on new licences, consolidation of MFB activities, capacity building, adoption of FinTech and creation of a national credit information system.

4.3 “Microfinance in Yemen: Overview of Challenges and Opportunities” (White Paper No. 6, Apr 2020)
	•	Historical development:  Microfinance began in Yemen in 1997, aiming to reduce poverty and unemployment.  The sector comprises formal microfinance banks (regulated by the CBY) and informal microfinance institutions (MFIs) funded by donors.
	•	Challenges:  The informal sector’s dependence on donor funds constrains long‑term planning.  The war disrupted operations and increased risks.  Microfinance institutions face poor management, low savings rates, religious opposition to interest and inflation.  Only a small share of Yemenis has formal financial accounts.
	•	Recommendations:  The paper calls for capacity building, improved financing (e.g., innovative risk‑sharing instruments), better program design (tailoring products to client needs) and further research.

4.4 “Fostering Opportunities for E‑Commerce Growth in Yemen” (Policy Brief 35, Sep 15 2025)
	•	Potential:  Yemen’s e‑commerce sector could drive growth and financial inclusion, particularly for women and rural communities.  Internet usage is only 17.7 % of the population (2024), but the arrival of Starlink offers promise.
	•	Challenges:  Poor internet connectivity, limited digital payment systems and lack of legal frameworks hinder development.  Yemen remains heavily cash‑based; only informal channels like Facebook and WhatsApp are used for online trade.  Conflict damage to transport networks restricts delivery.
	•	Recommendations:  Invest in satellite services (e.g., Starlink), develop cohesive e‑commerce regulations, improve digital literacy, enhance cybersecurity and promote public‑private cooperation to build infrastructure and digital payments.

4.5 “Impact Assessment of Aid Interventions in Yemen” (Dr Nadia Al‑Sakkaf, Mar 19 2025)
	•	Objective:  Traditional monitoring and evaluation often emphasise quantitative, short‑term results and neglect stakeholder perceptions.  This study introduces the Genuine Score of Impact (GSI) to assess aid projects’ real, lasting impacts on material wealth, social well‑being and empowerment.
	•	Method:  Mixed‑methods surveys and interviews were conducted in Lahj and Marib governorates, focusing on water, sanitation, health and food‑assistance projects.
	•	Findings:
	•	In Lahj, beneficiaries cited significant health benefits and improved community cohesion from health and sanitation interventions.
	•	In Marib, aid provided temporary relief but lacked sustainability.  Non‑beneficiary communities complained of unfulfilled needs and poor governance.
	•	Significance:  The GSI framework highlights the need to include community perceptions and long‑term impacts in aid evaluations and emphasises that aid programmes must consider sustainability and stakeholder engagement.

5 Key Cross‑Cutting Insights
	1.	Dual central banks and currency war:  The 2016 split created two competing CBY branches, leading to a fractured monetary policy.  The Houthis’ ban on new Aden banknotes and attempts to introduce e‑Rials triggered black‑market trading, multiple exchange rates and deeper economic fragmentation .  Without cooperation between branches, monetary chaos will persist .
	2.	Fiscal collapse:  Oil exports and tax revenues have declined sharply because of Houthi blockades and economic warfare .  The internationally recognised government faces budget deficits and relies on irregular Saudi aid to pay salaries and electricity .
	3.	Institutional weakness:  Governance is hampered by political divisions within the PLC and corruption at key institutions like the CBY‑Aden  .  Strengthening institutions and anti‑corruption mechanisms is crucial for reform.
	4.	Humanitarian crisis and aid effectiveness:  Millions of Yemenis are near famine; civil servants’ salaries remain unpaid; and aid programmes often lack sustainability .  Evaluating aid through local perceptions and long‑term impact (GSI) can improve programme design.
	5.	Development finance:  Access to climate finance and microfinance is limited by institutional capacity and regulatory gaps.  Policy briefs call for creating national funds, task forces, robust regulation and strengthening microfinance banks to expand financial inclusion.
	6.	Digital economy opportunities:  Despite poor infrastructure, there is potential for e‑commerce and FinTech to drive economic growth.  Policymakers must invest in connectivity, digital literacy and consumer protection to unlock this potential.

## 6 Recent Political and Security Developments (2024–2025)

The quarterly Yemen Review series by the Sana’a Center provides granular updates on the shifting military, diplomatic and economic landscape. Two recent editions—January–March 2025 and July–September 2024—illustrate how international interventions and domestic fragmentation continue to shape Yemen’s trajectory.

### 6.1 The Yemen Review: January–March 2025 (Published April 21 2025)
	•	Operation Rough Rider and US policy shifts:  In mid‑March 2025, the United States under President Donald Trump launched Operation Rough Rider, a large‑scale air campaign against the Houthi movement.  The campaign targeted missile depots, underground installations and senior leaders; as of April 14, at least 123 civilians and an estimated 101 Houthi combatants were reported killed .  The strikes followed Trump’s re‑designation of the Houthis as a Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO) on March 4, reversing the Biden administration’s 2021 rescission.  Sanctions were broadened to include Yemen Kuwait Bank, disrupting remittances and aid flows and severing the bank from international financial systems .  OFAC revised general licences to allow humanitarian transactions but imposed strict controls on refined petroleum imports .
	•	Humanitarian and economic fallout:  The FTO designation and airstrikes aggravated an already dire humanitarian situation.  WFP reported that 62 percent of Yemenis faced inadequate food consumption, up 15 percent year‑on‑year .  The rial plummeted to record lows in government areas while fuel shortages caused prolonged blackouts .  USAID temporarily suspended funding, forcing the WFP to halt dozens of projects .  Banks in Houthi areas risk losing access to SWIFT and remittance networks unless they relocate to Aden .
	•	Internal government tensions:  Political infighting within the Presidential Leadership Council (PLC) intensified.  Prime Minister Ahmed Awad bin Mubarak clashed with PLC chief Rashad al‑Alimi over cabinet appointments and anti‑corruption investigations .  Saudi Arabia convened PLC members in Riyadh to defuse tensions and insisted that officials return to Aden, but security fears kept many abroad .  A leaked report showing that PLC members had collected over US$104 million in salaries and allowances since 2022 fueled public outrage .
	•	Hadramawt tribal mobilization:  The oil‑rich governorate of Hadramawt witnessed new calls for autonomy.  Deputy governor Amr bin Habrish led the Hadramawt Tribal Alliance (HTA) in blocking fuel shipments to Aden until demands for local control and a greater share of oil revenues were met .  The HTA announced the formation of a Hadramawt Protection Force, prompting condemnation from UAE‑backed military units .  PLC member and former governor Faraj al‑Bahsani staged a walkout to protest the lack of progress on decentralization promises .
	•	Suspension of maritime attacks and renewed escalation:  In January 2025 the Houthis temporarily suspended Red Sea attacks on shipping, contributing to a brief resurgence of maritime traffic .  However, the group threatened to resume attacks if negotiations with Israel faltered, and in March the US renewed airstrikes in response to a Houthi ultimatum that aid be allowed into Gaza .  Operation Rough Rider then expanded to target Houthi leadership and infrastructure, escalating regional tensions .
	•	Significance:  The January–March 2025 review underscores how external actors (particularly the US and Saudi Arabia) and internal divisions (within the PLC and between regional factions) shape Yemen’s conflict.  Sanctions and counterterrorism measures risk worsening humanitarian conditions and fragmenting the financial sector, while tribal mobilisation in Hadramawt highlights the fragility of central authority.

### 6.2 The Yemen Review: July–September 2024 (Published Oct 16 2024)
	•	Houthi–Israeli escalation:  On July 19 2024, a Houthi drone struck Tel Aviv, killing one person—the first Houthi attack to cause casualties in Israel .  Israel retaliated with airstrikes on the port of Hudaydah, destroying fuel stores and raising concerns about interruptions to humanitarian aid .  Further Houthi attacks on September 15 prompted additional Israeli strikes on port and power facilities .
	•	Red Sea dynamics:  Red Sea attacks on shipping fell from 21 incidents to 12 during the quarter, partly because the US and UK destroyed 141 weapons systems .  Yet the Houthis continued to threaten shipping, and an attack on the Greek tanker Sounion highlighted environmental risks .
	•	Domestic turmoil:  Fighting between Houthi and pro‑government forces persisted across frontlines such as Taiz‑Lahj, Hudaydah and Marib .  Houthi authorities arrested hundreds ahead of the September 26 republic revolution anniversary and aired forced confessions of detained embassy staff .  They also reshuffled their cabinet, appointing loyalists and expanding control over the judiciary .
	•	Political contestation and disasters:  In the south, protests erupted after the kidnapping of a pro‑government commander, undermining Southern Transitional Council (STC) authority .  In Hadramawt, rumours of revenue‑sharing deals with the Houthis spurred tribal groups to block fuel shipments and demand autonomy .  Heavy flooding during the kharif rain season killed nearly 100 people and affected over half a million, damaging farmland and exacerbating cholera outbreaks .
	•	Central bank showdown:  The Aden‑based CBY attempted to sever six Sana’a banks from the SWIFT network to assert authority but backed down under Riyadh’s orders after the Houthis threatened retaliation .  The episode illustrated the delicate balance between competing branches of the central bank and the influence of Saudi Arabia on economic decisions.
	•	Significance:  The July–September 2024 review shows a conflict spilling across borders and into the Red Sea.  Israeli strikes on Hudaydah marked a new regional dimension to the war, while domestic governance crises—including Houthi repression, STC infighting, and tribal contestation—highlight the disintegration of state authority.  Environmental disasters further strained the country, and the central bank clash pointed to persistent monetary fragmentation.

Conclusion

The reviewed sources collectively depict a Yemen trapped in a vicious cycle of political fragmentation, economic collapse and humanitarian crisis.  Reforms must tackle structural governance flaws, unify monetary policy, restore public revenue streams and invest in institutional capacity.  International support, whether through IMF SDRs, climate finance, or humanitarian aid, will only be effective if managed transparently and used to rebuild institutions.  At the same time, forward‑looking initiatives—such as fostering e‑commerce, expanding microfinance and accessing climate finance—offer pathways to inclusive growth if regulatory barriers are addressed.  Understanding the complexities of Yemen’s economy and society requires continuous monitoring of these dynamic factors and integration of local perspectives to craft sustainable solutions.

Financial and Banking‑Related Publications at the Sana’a Center (2015‑2025)

This document catalogues every report, analysis, policy brief and editorial from the Sana’a Center for Strategic Studies (Sana’a Center) that deals primarily with financial issues, banking, the Central Bank of Yemen (CBY) or monetary policy.  The list covers publications from 2015 through late 2025 and summarises the key points and findings of each piece.  Where possible, citations from the original articles are provided to anchor specific facts.

Overview

Yemen’s banking system and monetary policy have been a focus of the Sana’a Center since the outbreak of the war.  The Central Bank’s relocation from Sana’a to Aden in 2016 and its subsequent bifurcation created two competing monetary authorities.  This split, combined with currency printing, sanctions, foreign interference and the proliferation of informal money exchanges, has destabilised the Yemeni rial, undermined public confidence in banks and contributed to severe inflation.  The Sana’a Center’s financial publications trace this evolving crisis, propose reforms and document the humanitarian consequences of monetary collapse.

2016: Early warnings and the CBY relocation

Ensuring Yemen’s State Structures Survive the Conflict (Feb 2016)

Context

By early 2016, Yemen’s war had destroyed much of the country’s infrastructure and fractured political authority.  The Houthis and allied forces had seized Sana’a in September 2014 and pushed President Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi’s government to the southern city of Aden.  The Saudi‑led coalition intervened militarily in March 2015, imposing a sea, land and air blockade that halted oil exports and cut customs revenues.  This analysis, written by Mansour Rageh for the Sana’a Center in February 2016, warned that Yemen’s Central Bank of Yemen (CBY) and core state institutions were on the brink of collapse.  It argued that preserving the currency and the bare minimum of government operations was essential to avert famine and facilitate post‑war reconstruction.

Structural weaknesses in public finances
	•	Reliance on oil and corruption:  Prior to the conflict, Yemen’s government revenue was heavily dependent on oil exports and plagued by patronage networks .  Between 2009‑2013, budget deficits ranged from 4.6–8.3 % of GDP, with spending exceeding revenue by 16–27 % each year .  Oil exports accounted for about two‑thirds of revenue .
	•	2015 budget crisis:  The 2015 budget projected US$10.3 billion in revenue (46 % from oil, 31.8 % from taxes and customs, 8 % from external grants) against US$13.4 billion in spending, implying a deficit of US$3.1 billion .  Yet actual revenue available was estimated at only US$4.6 billion, or 44 % of the projection, due to the collapse of oil exports, customs receipts and foreign aid .  Operational expenses, mainly public sector salaries and debt service, remained about US$700 million per month, totaling US$8.5 billion for the year.  This created a funding gap of roughly US$3.9 billion just to keep essential services running .
	•	Seizure of state revenues:  Warring parties were seizing public companies and siphoning revenues.  The Houthis took over state firms like the National Tobacco & Matches Company and allowed black‑market dealers to replace the Yemen Petroleum Company (YPC) as fuel importer .  These illicit activities enriched war profiteers and deprived the government of customs and fuel taxes .

Central Bank of Yemen’s role and vulnerabilities

The CBY remained one of the last functional state institutions.  Its mandate included maintaining the riyal’s value, financing government deficits via domestic borrowing and paying 1.2 million public sector salaries.  Key points from the article:
	•	Foreign reserves collapse:  Yemen’s foreign currency reserves fell from over US$6 billion in 2012 to US$2.1 billion by January 2016; about US$1 billion of the latter was a Saudi deposit maturing in 2017 .  Excluding that deposit, reserves would cover less than two months of imports .
	•	Currency stability:  Despite the conflict, the CBY kept the official exchange rate at YR 215 per US$1, while the black‑market rate hovered around YR 250 per US$1 (a 16 % difference) .  The bank restricted access to foreign currency, limited credit lines for importers and mandated that government transactions remain in riyals .
	•	Pressure from deregulated fuel imports:  Facing fuel shortages, the Houthis issued fuel import licences to private traders.  Black‑market fuel sold for 6,000 YR per 20 liters, more than double the YPC’s official price of 2,800 YR, yet it was constantly available .  Profits were so high that importers could purchase dollars at any exchange rate, putting further downward pressure on the riyal and depriving the state of taxes .

Humanitarian implications
	•	Risk of famine:  Yemen imports 90 % of its food, so currency stability is essential for purchasing basic commodities .  By early 2016, 21 million Yemenis (about 80 % of the population) needed humanitarian assistance .  If the CBY’s foreign reserves were exhausted, the riyal would collapse, public finances would implode and millions would face extreme hunger .
	•	Dwindling import capacity:  The CBY’s dwindling reserves meant it could no longer guarantee letters of credit for critical imports such as sugar, forcing importers to use the black market .  Any further devaluation would instantly increase the cost of food and fuel, exacerbating the humanitarian crisis.

Policy recommendations

The article argued that conflict cessation was the surest way to stabilise the economy but proposed interim measures for stakeholders:
	1.	Stop plundering state institutions:  Saudi Arabia, Iran and other backers should pressure their local allies to cease looting state revenues .
	2.	Re‑empower the YPC:  End the sale of private fuel licences and allow the YPC to resume regulated imports; introduce a temporary fuel tax to raise revenue and curb excessive consumption .
	3.	Restart limited oil exports:  Encourage SAFER Exploration & Production and foreign companies to resume safe, small‑scale exports to rebuild reserves, while ensuring revenues are not diverted to war spending .
	4.	Ease the blockade:  The Saudi‑led coalition should facilitate the flow of fuel and commodities through Yemeni ports and ensure distribution networks are protected from airstrikes .
	5.	Narrow public expenditures:  Prioritise payment of public sector salaries and minimum debt service; suspend non‑essential spending until revenues recover .
	6.	Allow currency transfers:  Permit commercial banks to exchange surplus Saudi riyals for US dollars to meet demand and facilitate imports .
	7.	Maintain CBY neutrality:  Keep the CBY independent of warring factions and support its efforts with foreign currency aid.  Options include allowing the CBY to access external accounts, direct purchases of Yemeni riyals by foreign donors or using aid programmes to inject riyals into the economy .

Significance

At the time of publication (February 2016), this report served as an urgent warning that Yemen’s economy was nearing free‑fall.  It highlighted the paradox that the country’s last functioning institution – the CBY – was simultaneously protecting the currency and financing the war through deficit spending.  The report foreshadowed the September 2016 relocation of the CBY to Aden and the subsequent split between rival central banks, which would later trigger a protracted currency war.  It also underlined the humanitarian stakes: maintaining the riyal’s value and state salaries was not merely an economic concern but a life‑saving necessity for millions of Yemenis.

Beware of the Failure of Yemen’s Central Bank (May 2016)

Overview and Context

Published on May 15 2016, this Sana’a Center analysis warned that the Central Bank of Yemen (CBY)—one of the last functioning state institutions—was at risk of collapse amid the country’s widening civil war.  The Houthi takeover of Sana’a in September 2014 had already precipitated the flight of President Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi’s government to Aden and then Riyadh.  By spring 2015, the Houthi‑Saleh alliance controlled much of Yemen and the Saudi‑led coalition had begun its intervention.  Public institutions, including health and education, were barely functioning: there were only three doctors per 10,000 people and 14 million Yemenis needed help accessing healthcare .  Around 1.8 million children were out of school .

In this environment, the CBY remained the linchpin of economic stability.  This article, first published in Al‑Monitor, underscores how fragile that stability had become and argues that without immediate political and financial support, Yemen would face hyperinflation and deeper poverty.

CBY as the last bulwark
	•	Role and leadership:  The CBY had maintained a careful monetary policy since the 2011 uprising, preserving the Yemeni rial’s value and preventing hyperinflation .  A key factor was the technocratic, bipartisan leadership of Governor Mohammed Awad Bin Hammam, who was widely respected in an otherwise polarised country .  When Hadi and his government fled in March 2015, Bin Hammam’s stewardship allowed the CBY to continue operating .
	•	Saudi support:  A US$1 billion deposit from Saudi Arabia in 2012 and ongoing fuel and oil aid had bolstered Yemen’s financial system .  These contributions reflected Riyadh’s role as sponsor of the Gulf Cooperation Council Initiative that facilitated Hadi’s transitional government .

Measures to defend the rial

The CBY enacted a series of emergency policies to defend the rial and manage scarce foreign exchange:
	1.	Banning cashing of foreign transfers:  In 2015 the CBY prohibited banks and exchange companies from paying out remittances in foreign currency for several months.  This measure sought to stem the dollar drain amid collapsing trade and the coalition’s airstrikes .
	2.	Managing the exchange rate:  Early in 2016 the CBY devalued the official exchange rate by 17 %, from YR 214 to 250 per US$ .  This devaluation signalled to the market that the CBY recognised the scarcity of hard currency and was willing to adapt.  At the time, the black‑market rate was around YR 279/US$, roughly 11.6 % lower than the official rate .  The CBY aimed to narrow the gap and restore confidence.
	3.	Restricting currency speculation:  Facing dwindling reserves, the CBY and Houthi authorities arrested currency exchange shop owners who violated the official rate .  This crackdown was intended to enforce adherence to the official rate and prevent speculative runs.

Depleting foreign reserves

The article emphasised the alarming decline in foreign reserves:
	•	Pre‑war reserves:  Reserves fell from US$5.35 billion in 2013 to US$4.6 billion in November 2014 .
	•	Conflict period:  By the end of 2015 reserves had dropped to US$2.1 billion, according to Yemen’s Ministry of Planning and International Cooperation .  The newly appointed prime minister Ahmed Obeid bin Daghr later reported reserves at just US$1.3 billion—about 28 % of pre‑war levels .
	•	Causes:  While some accused the Houthis of withdrawing funds to finance their war efforts , the article contends that the principal driver of reserve depletion was the soaring demand for foreign currency as imports shrank and remittances became Yemen’s primary foreign exchange source.

As reserves declined, the CBY’s ability to implement anti‑inflationary policy narrowed .  Without adequate reserves, the rial would plummet, leading to capital flight, commodity price spikes and widening inequality .

Political dimensions and external references

The piece references several external reports and signals to underscore the gravity of the situation:
	•	Health and education crisis:  Al‑Monitor articles are cited to show the collapse of public services and the shortage of healthcare workers .
	•	Economic context:  The IMF and Al‑Monitor analyses are referenced to highlight Yemen’s fragility and the importance of the 2012 Saudi deposit .
	•	Ministry of Planning report:  An April 2016 report from the Ministry of Planning urged a US$5 billion deposit to rescue the financial system and called for an immediate political solution .
	•	International media:  The article notes that the World Bank estimated Yemen’s inflation at 30 % in 2015 and that the devaluation would likely push it higher .

Takeaways
	1.	Central bank as stabiliser:  The CBY’s ability to maintain currency stability amid war hinged on its technocratic leadership and credibility.  Its independence allowed it to implement difficult policies such as banning foreign‑currency payouts and adjusting the official exchange rate.
	2.	External support matters:  Saudi Arabia’s deposit and fuel aid were vital lifelines.  Without additional injections of foreign currency, reserves were drying up rapidly.  The Ministry of Planning’s call for a US$5 billion deposit underscored the scale of support needed .
	3.	Demand for foreign currency:  The main driver of reserve depletion was not only Houthi withdrawals but structural: Yemen imports most basic goods and had to finance these purchases in dollars.  Remittances were insufficient to offset the collapse of oil exports and other foreign exchange sources.
	4.	Interdependence of politics and economics:  The article asserts that no monetary policy can succeed without a political solution.  Stability and the CBY’s efforts will be undermined if the war continues and state institutions fragment .

Yemen Without a Functioning Central Bank (Nov 2016)

Executive context

This long report, released on November 2 2016 by the Sana’a Center, examined the consequences of the internationally recognized Yemeni government’s decision in September 2016 to relocate the Central Bank of Yemen (CBY) from Sana’a to Aden and replace its governor.  Written by Mansour Rageh and Farea al‑Muslimi, it argued that the relocation incapacitated the only institution capable of stabilising Yemen’s economy and that millions of Yemenis faced starvation if the CBY’s functions were not restored.  By October 2016 Yemen’s humanitarian crisis had been elevated to UN Level 3, placing it alongside Syria, Iraq and South Sudan .

The CBY’s essential roles before relocation

The report underscores how, despite years of upheaval and war, the CBY had continued to function nationwide:
	•	Macroeconomic management:  The CBY rolled over the last official budget (2014) into 2015 and 2016, effectively running macroeconomic policy after President Hadi fled .  Budget deficits of 4.6–8.3 % of GDP between 2009–2013 were financed through external loans, domestic bonds and CBY lending, leaving the government owing the CBY US$3.5 billion by December 2014 .
	•	Paying salaries and financing local councils:  The CBY facilitated a national revenue‑sharing system.  Local councils collected taxes and deposited them with local CBY branches; in return, the CBY disbursed operating funds for public sector salaries and services .  Even after Aden was retaken by Hadi’s forces, CBY headquarters in Sana’a chartered flights to deliver cash to Aden to cover budget allocations .
	•	Paying both sides:  The CBY continued to pay all Ministry of Defense employees registered in 2014, meaning soldiers fighting for both the Houthis and the internationally recognized government were receiving salaries from the same institution .  This favoured the Houthis, who had added thousands of militiamen to the payroll after seizing Sana’a .
	•	Preserving the Yemeni rial:  Yemen imports 90 % of its food, so protecting the currency’s value is vital.  The CBY maintained an official rate of YR 215 per US$ for years and intervened to limit parallel market trading .  After the coalition intervention, oil and gas exports halted, GDP contracted by ~30 % and the CBY spent US$1 billion to prop up the rial .  By October 2016 the black‑market rate had reached YR 310/US$, a 24 % difference from the official YR 250/US$ rate .
	•	Managing foreign reserves:  Foreign currency reserves peaked above US$6 billion in 2012 (bolstered by a US$1 billion Saudi deposit) .  They declined to US$2.8 billion by mid‑2015 and US$2.1 billion by January 2016 .  The CBY used these reserves to finance basic imports, focusing on wheat and rice; in the first half of 2016 it financed US$414 million in imports, almost 70 % of which went to wheat .
	•	Managing liquidity:  Yemen is a cash economy.  The CBY anticipated a liquidity crisis in mid‑2016 as public mistrust led individuals to withdraw money.  Between January and May 2016, 160 billion YER left the banking system, with another 140 billion YER withdrawn in June .  The government blocked the CBY from printing new notes in Russia, forcing the bank to re‑issue damaged banknotes that many businesses refused .

Scenarios and contingency planning

In January 2016, the CBY sent a confidential report to the government outlining three scenarios:
	1.	Continue supporting the rial and imports until reserves run out:  This would exhaust foreign currency reserves by September 2016, offering short‑term stability but risking default on foreign debt and loss of market confidence .
	2.	Reduce import financing:  Cutting lines of credit for fuel and sugar while continuing to finance wheat and rice could leave US$1 billion in reserves at year’s end .  Traders would have to buy dollars on the open market, putting downward pressure on the rial.
	3.	Float the currency and stop import financing:  This would preserve reserves but cause a rapid devaluation and commodity price spikes .

The CBY planned to pursue scenario 2 until reserves were depleted, then adopt scenario 3 .  Through the first half of 2016 the CBY spent about US$780 million in foreign currency, leaving it with roughly US$1.3 billion to begin the second half of the year .

Undermining and relocation of the CBY

The internationally recognized government gradually eroded the CBY’s neutrality:
	•	Oil receipts diverted:  When Mukalla port was liberated from Al‑Qaeda in June 2016, the proceeds from resumed oil exports were deposited in a new account at the Saudi National Bank instead of the CBY .
	•	Public accusations:  Prime Minister Ahmed Obaid bin Dagher accused Governor Mohammed Awad Bin Humam of misusing reserves and requested the IMF freeze the CBY’s accounts .  The government claimed the CBY had funnelled US$4 billion to the Houthis .  Western diplomats and financial institutions widely viewed these accusations as baseless, affirming Bin Humam’s technocratic neutrality .
	•	Freezing reserves:  International banks complied with the government’s request to deny the CBY access to foreign accounts, effectively imposing economic sanctions that severed the bank from its remaining foreign currency .
	•	Decree to relocate:  On September 18 2016, President Hadi decreed that the CBY headquarters be moved to Aden and that Bin Humam be replaced by Monasser al‑Quaiti .  The move was widely criticised as an attempt to weaponize the economy .  Hadi acknowledged that it could prevent payment of public servants’ salaries .
	•	Operational breakdown:  The new CBY in Aden lacked the 800 experienced staff, archives and expertise to function .  Security in Aden was poor; a car bomb hit the bank site.  Governor al‑Quaiti promised to resume core functions but offered no substantive plan, eroding confidence .  Even Saudi Arabia and the UAE delayed delivering promised funds .

Consequences for humanitarian crisis

The CBY’s incapacitation exacerbated Yemen’s humanitarian disaster:
	•	Malnutrition and displacement:  As of October 2016, 370,000 children suffered severe malnutrition and 1.5 million faced life‑threatening malnutrition .  More than 3 million people were displaced; 30 % of Yemenis faced severe food insecurity; four out of five needed assistance .  Ten governorates were on the brink of famine .
	•	Poverty:  The World Bank reported Yemen’s poverty rate doubled from 34 % in 2014 to 62 % by spring 2016 .
	•	Salaries and households:  Nearly 1.2 million civil servants (heads of households for roughly 6 million people) had not been paid since August 2016 .  The Social Welfare Fund, which supported the poorest, had stopped payments in December 2014 .
	•	Blockade and infrastructure:  The coalition blockade restricted commercial goods and aid .  Airstrikes destroyed ports, roads, and essential infrastructure, impeding humanitarian delivery .

Recommendations and outlook

The report insisted that ending the war is the surest way to mitigate the crisis.  Short of that, it called for:
	1.	Empowering the CBY irrespective of location:  Local, regional and international stakeholders must pressure the warring parties to respect the CBY’s neutrality and support its operations, whether in Sana’a or Aden .
	2.	Paying civil servants:  Immediate resumption of salary payments to prevent millions from falling into famine .
	3.	Restoring import credits:  Wheat importers said domestic supplies would be exhausted in two months without financing .  The CBY must extend lines of credit for basic fuel and food imports .
	4.	Supporting welfare programs:  Reinstate the Social Welfare Fund and stabilise the rial to alleviate the liquidity crisis .
	5.	Rescheduling debt:  Maintain or renegotiate foreign debt to preserve Yemen’s eligibility for future loans and aid .
	6.	Avoid weaponizing the economy:  The international community must prevent the use of starvation as a war tactic and encourage cooperation between staff in Sana’a and Aden .

The report warned that establishing separate central banks—either by the Houthis in Sana’a or the Hadi government in Aden—would deepen mistrust and push Yemen’s financial system toward collapse .  Cooperation between both sites was the only viable path to restore monetary stability .

How Currency Arbitrage Has Reduced the Funds Available to Address the Humanitarian Crisis (Sept 6 2017)

Context and overview

By September 2017, Yemen had been at war for more than two years.  The Central Bank of Yemen (CBY) had split between rival governments in Sana’a (controlled by the Houthi–Saleh alliance’s Government of National Salvation, GNS) and Aden (internationally recognised government, IRG) after its relocation in late 2016.  The economy collapsed; oil exports halted; foreign reserves dwindled; and the Yemeni rial plunged on the parallel market while the official exchange rate remained fixed at YR 250 per USD .  Humanitarian agencies responded by shifting from in‑kind assistance to cash transfers in mid‑2016 because local markets were still able to provide goods, and cash transfers offered flexibility and multiplier effects  .  Donors exchanged USD at the official rate through Yemeni banks, then distributed rials to beneficiaries.

The article reveals that the growing gap between the official and market exchange rates created lucrative currency‑arbitrage opportunities for banks and exchange houses.  By mid‑2017, banks were reselling humanitarian funds at market rates, profiting from the difference, while aid organisations’ purchasing power declined.

The exchange-rate gap and currency arbitrage

Before the conflict there was little difference between official and market exchange rates: the CBY maintained a managed float around YR 214.9 per USD .  As the war escalated and oil exports were suspended, the CBY’s foreign reserves dwindled and downward pressure on the rial intensified .  By the second quarter of 2016, the market rate had fallen to YR 280 per USD, 30 % lower than the official rate .  The CBY devalued the official rate to YR 250 per USD but market depreciation continued.  When the bank was relocated to Aden without transferring expertise or reserves, its capacity to supervise currency markets collapsed .  By July 2017 the parallel market rate reached YR 367 per USD, representing a total loss of 70 % of the rial’s value since the conflict began and 47 % lower than the official rate .

Humanitarian organisations continued to convert their USD at the official rate (YR 250), reluctant to conduct transactions outside the formal system .  Meanwhile, most Yemeni banks and money exchangers already operated at market rates, so they profited by exchanging donors’ USD at the official rate and then selling the rials on the parallel market .  The article cites Sana’a Center financial sources indicating that one major Yemeni bank earned almost US$80 million in profits between January and August 2017 from such arbitrage .  In effect, humanitarian funds intended for vulnerable Yemenis were diverted to bank profits.

Impact on humanitarian assistance

The disparity severely eroded the reach of cash‑transfer programmes.  The Food Security and Agriculture Cluster priced a standard monthly food basket at YR 24,000 per family .  Exchanging USD at the official rate, the basket cost US$96, whereas at the July 2017 market rate (YR 367 per USD) it cost only US$65.40 .  Assuming 1.9 million beneficiaries received cash transfers at the official rate, the same funds exchanged at the market rate could have assisted almost 2.8 million people .  This loss of capacity occurred amid severe funding shortfalls; the World Food Programme warned that a 65 % funding level would force it to cut off 3 million severely food‑insecure people from general food assistance .  The article also notes that banks’ arbitrage profits were largely used for wealth accumulation rather than financing essential imports .

CBY policy shift: floating the rial

On August 14 2017, the CBY in Aden announced that it would float the value of the rial, linking the official rate to the market .  According to Sana’a Center sources, the decision resulted from World Bank pressure and negotiations between UNICEF and banks in Sana’a regarding the exchange rate, preparing for nearly US$400 million in new humanitarian aid from the World Bank to UNICEF and the United Nations Development Programme .  The first US$50 million tranche, exchanged at the market rate, was expected to reach 1.5 million beneficiaries across six governorates .  However, the Houthis in northern Yemen refused to recognise the new CBY governor and maintained tariffs at the fixed rate of YR 250 per USD, while continuing to collect customs revenues at Hudaydah port .  This created a dual exchange‑rate environment: market rate in government areas vs. fixed rate in Houthi areas, complicating monetary management and trade.

Recommendations and policy options

The article argues that neither the fixed rate nor a fully floating currency is ideal under current conditions.  A full float might trigger rapid devaluation because the CBY is divided, lacks reserves and cannot intervene effectively .  Instead, the Sana’a Center recommends:
	1.	Dedicated aid exchange rate – Calculate a special exchange rate for humanitarian funds using the moving average of the market rate over the previous three months; if the difference between the aid rate and the market rate exceeds 10 %, the rate should be re‑evaluated .
	2.	Monitoring and transparency – The CBY and humanitarian actors should develop monitoring and reporting mechanisms, declaring daily market and aid exchange rates and reporting all humanitarian fund exchanges to the central bank .
	3.	Coordination with banks – Increase coordination between the CBY and local banks to ensure that foreign currency from aid flows is used to import essential goods rather than fuel speculative profits .

Humanitarian context and references

The article situates currency arbitrage within Yemen’s broader humanitarian emergency.  FAO declared Yemen “the world’s largest humanitarian crisis” in February 2017 (cited in notes), and by July 2017 the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) reported that 20.7 million Yemenis needed some form of assistance, up from 18.8 million in January; 17 million were food insecure (6.8 million severely so), while 8 million lacked clean water .  Yemen’s GDP had contracted 37 % between 2014 and 2016 .  Roughly 1.2 million civil servants, supporting about 7 million people, had not been paid since September 2016 .  Public service breakdowns (healthcare, water, garbage collection) contributed to a cholera epidemic with 500,000 suspected cases and more than 2,000 deaths by mid‑August 2017 .  Aid appeals were severely underfunded: the UN’s $1.63 billion appeal for 2016 was only 60 % funded, and the updated $2.3 billion appeal for 2017 was only 41.7 % funded by September .

Takeaways and insights
	1.	Currency arbitrage siphons humanitarian funds:  Because aid agencies exchanged money at the official rate while banks operated at market rates, a significant share of aid was captured by private banks.  This reduced the number of beneficiaries and undermined food security at a time when millions faced hunger.
	2.	Dual exchange rates fuel fragmentation:  The divergence between official and parallel rates created incentives for speculation and strengthened the black market.  Floating the rial may help align rates, but without unified monetary governance it risks volatility.
	3.	Need for a special aid rate:  The proposed moving‑average aid rate aims to protect the value of humanitarian funds, stabilise prices and prevent speculative profits.  Its adoption requires coordination between CBY branches, banks and aid agencies.
	4.	Humanitarian urgency:  The article underscores that currency policies have immediate human consequences in Yemen.  The difference between exchange rates could mean life or death for hundreds of thousands of people, as aid resources become scarce and the economy contracts.
	5.	Political implications:  The Houthis’ refusal to adopt the new CBY policies and their continued tariffs at a fixed rate illustrate how monetary issues are entangled with territorial control and revenue collection.  Without political reconciliation and a unified central bank, technical monetary reforms will have limited impact.

This analysis deepens the understanding of Yemen’s monetary crisis by examining how the October 2017 crash and the emergence of diverging monetary policies threatened to formalise economic division and destabilise the rial.  Subsequent deliverables will continue to build on this knowledge base.

Restoring Central Bank Capacity and Stabilizing the Rial (Feb 8 2018)

Context and rationale

By early 2018, the Yemeni rial had deteriorated dramatically: it traded around YR 530 per USD in mid‑January 2018, compared with YR 215 per USD before the conflict .  This collapse was a major driver of Yemen’s food insecurity, as millions of people could no longer afford to buy food.  Recognizing that a functioning and unified Central Bank of Yemen (CBY) is essential for economic stability, the “Rethinking Yemen’s Economy” initiative convened more than 20 Yemeni economic experts at the Development Champions Forum in Amman (January 14–16, 2018).  They identified currency depreciation and central bank fragmentation as urgent issues and drafted this policy brief to provide practical recommendations for re‑empowering the CBY and stabilising the rial.  Saudi Arabia’s announcement on January 17 of a US$2 billion deposit to the CBY reinforced the need for coordinated deployment of foreign reserves .

Key problems identified
	•	Fragmented monetary authority: After President Hadi relocated the CBY to Aden in September 2016, the bank split into rival branches that could not coordinate monetary policy.  Leadership remained abroad (Amman and Riyadh), making effective management impossible .
	•	Loss of foreign currency access: Yemeni commercial banks struggled to transfer foreign currency abroad due to the closure of Sana’a airport and foreign banks closing accounts over compliance concerns .
	•	Severe liquidity and currency depreciation: The rial’s value plunged to YR 530 per USD, cutting purchasing power.  The CBY printed money to relieve liquidity shortages, but this risked further depreciation .
	•	Lack of transparency and public trust: CBY leadership operated from abroad; little information on liquidity and bank balance sheets was shared, undermining confidence .

Recommendations to the Central Bank of Yemen (CBY)
	1.	Fulfil legal mandate (Law 14 of 2000): Manage all government foreign currency accounts and abide by CBY Law 14 and its amendments .  This would ensure that revenues and reserves are properly managed under central authority.
	2.	Regulate currency printing: Carefully balance printing new rials to ease the liquidity crisis against the risk of further depreciation; use per‑capita purchasing power relative to basic commodities as a guiding metric .
	3.	Coordinate deployment of the US$2 billion deposit: Establish coordination mechanisms with Yemeni banks, money exchangers and large private sector actors to maximise the stabilising impact of the deposit and support essential imports .
	4.	Curb market manipulation: Enact policies and legal procedures with banks and large firms to reduce currency market manipulation; punish violators with sanctions .
	5.	Pay interest on treasury bills: Resume paying interest to commercial banks on government treasury bills to inject liquidity and encourage banks to offer interest on deposits.  This would rebuild customer trust and stimulate savings .
	6.	Relocate CBY leadership to Yemen: Senior management must return to Aden to effectively manage the bank; remote leadership from Amman or Riyadh is inadequate .
	7.	Enhance transparency: Publish monthly, quarterly and annual reports, including balance sheets and liquidity data, to domestic and international stakeholders .
	8.	Re‑activate the Financial Information Unit (FIU): The FIU, responsible for anti‑money‑laundering and counter‑terrorism financing oversight, should resume operations and coordinate with MENAFATF to reduce compliance risks that led foreign banks to close Yemeni accounts .

Recommendations to the Government of Yemen (GoY)
	1.	Centralise foreign currency accounts: Deposit all government foreign currency revenues into CBY accounts as required by law; cease maintaining separate accounts abroad (e.g., at Ahli Bank in Saudi Arabia) .
	2.	Improve revenue collection and anti‑corruption: Enhance mechanisms for taxes, customs and oil/gas revenues; deposit funds into CBY accounts; share the national budget and economic data with Parliament .
	3.	Avoid inflationary financing: Do not print new rials to cover expenditures; increase the use of cheques rather than cash in state revenue collection to reduce liquidity shortages and corruption .
	4.	Re‑activate anti‑money‑laundering committee: Restart the National Committee to Combat Money Laundering and Terrorism Financing .
	5.	Establish an advisory team on fiscal and economic policy: Include representatives from state institutions, economists and sectoral experts; provide counsel on socioeconomic matters to the government and regional/international stakeholders .
	6.	Increase oil and gas production: Strive to restore hydrocarbon output to pre‑conflict levels; engage Saudi authorities to reduce taxes on Yemeni diaspora workers, thereby increasing remittances .

Recommendations to the Saudi‑led coalition & international community
	1.	Provide additional foreign currency deposits: Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states should deposit more funds into the CBY to stabilise the rial, fund imports and restore basic services .
	2.	Facilitate trade finance: Assist Yemeni banks in securing trade finance for essential commodity imports; allow flights to transport foreign currency banknotes to Yemeni banks’ accounts in Bahrain .
	3.	Accelerate the Trade Finance Facility for Food Imports: Urge the World Bank Group to implement this facility announced in April 2017 .
	4.	Provide technical support and capacity building: Offer training, advisers and IT systems to help the CBY manage budgets, transactions and operations .
	5.	Improve oversight of oil import clearances: Coalition members controlling Red Sea ports should require proper payment documentation for oil shipments to reduce currency market manipulation and deter illicit imports .

Development Champions & collaborative initiative

The policy brief was produced by the Sana’a Center, DeepRoot Consulting and CARPO, funded by the European Union and the Netherlands.  It lists 20+ Yemeni development champions—including government officials, academics, business leaders, and civil society representatives (e.g., Jeehan Abdulghaffar, Dr. Asmahan Alalas, Omar Al‑Aqel, Badr Basalmah, Dr. Saadaldeen Talib, Dr. Souad Othman Yafeai)—underscoring the broad consensus behind the recommendations .  The document clarifies that these recommendations represent personal opinions, not official positions of the donors .

Takeaways and insights
	1.	Unified monetary authority is indispensable: Without a single central bank controlling foreign reserves and currency issuance, Yemen cannot stabilise its currency.  Reunification of the CBY and relocation of leadership back to Yemen are key.
	2.	Foreign deposits offer temporary relief, not a solution: The $2 billion Saudi deposit may buy time, but long‑term stability requires institutional reforms, transparent management and improved revenue collection.
	3.	Transparency rebuilds trust: Publishing regular reports and resuming anti‑money‑laundering oversight would help restore confidence among local banks, foreign correspondents and the public.
	4.	Coordination with private sector is crucial: Stabilising the rial and managing the liquidity crisis demands cooperation between the CBY, banks, money exchangers and large importers to ensure foreign currency is used to import necessities, not fuel speculation.
	5.	International actors must support trade finance: Lifting restrictions on Yemeni banks and enabling trade finance is essential to avoid supply bottlenecks and reduce reliance on informal networks.

Famine at Hand Without a Reunified Central Bank to Protect the Yemeni Rial (Oct 16 2018)

Context and key message

This short editorial, published in The Yemen Review in October 2018, highlights that the greatest threat facing Yemenis is not direct violence but the collapse of the Yemeni rial, which is driving mass famine.  By late September 2018 the rial had lost three‑quarters of its pre‑war value, sliding from YR 215 per USD (March 2015) to YR 760 per USD .  The currency’s decline accelerated over August–September, dropping 40 % in those two months alone .  This depreciation led to skyrocketing prices and a nationwide fuel crisis, leaving millions unable to afford food despite adequate supply .  The editorial warns that Yemen’s humanitarian crisis is fundamentally an economic crisis caused by deliberate policy choices, particularly the decision to split the central bank and print money.

Why the crisis is man‑made
	1.	Central bank division:  The internationally recognised government moved the CBY headquarters from Sana’a to Aden in September 2016.  This created two central banks operating independently on opposite sides of the war, rendering neither capable of effectively managing the currency or economy .  The editorial argues that reunifying the CBY is the most urgent step to protect the rial and should be the core of UN envoy Martin Griffiths’s economic de‑escalation efforts .
	2.	Insufficient financial support:  Gulf states promised deposits but delivered insufficient or poorly conditioned funding.  While Saudi Arabia deposited US$2 billion in early 2018, Riyadh’s conditions on how the funds could be used and the Aden CBY’s own restrictions limited their impact .  Former CBY governor Mohammed bin Hummam told the Sana’a Center that even this amount was likely inadequate .  The editorial notes that Bahrain received US$10 billion in support and Turkey US$15 billion from regional partners to stabilise their currencies, illustrating that far smaller sums could prevent famine in Yemen .
	3.	Remittance clampdown:  Saudi Arabia’s labour nationalisation campaign has expelled thousands of Yemeni expatriate workers, reducing remittances—Yemen’s largest source of foreign currency since oil and gas exports stopped in March 2015 .  The editorial urges Riyadh to halt expulsions to maintain this lifeline.
	4.	Money printing and corruption:  The Yemeni government continues to pay civil servant salaries by ordering the Aden CBY to print new banknotes, expanding the money supply and further depreciating the rial .  The editorial calls on authorities to stop printing money and instead focus on restoring oil and gas production, the previous source of revenue .  It also demands that the newly appointed Prime Minister Maeen Abdulmalik activate transparency mechanisms, address corruption allegations and curb lavish spending .
	5.	Limited influence of the Aden CBY:  The Aden CBY announced plans to speed up import financing and collaborate with banks and exchangers to stabilise the rial .  However, the largest banks and financial players are based in Sana’a, limiting the Aden CBY’s reach .  Thus, without reunification, policies from Aden alone will be ineffective.

Proposed solutions
	•	Reunify the Central Bank:  Multilateral pressure must compel both the Yemeni government and the armed Houthi movement to reunify the CBY and allow it to operate independently of the belligerents .
	•	Provide substantial financial support:  Gulf countries should offer more generous and less restrictive deposits.  The editorial notes that only a fraction of the funds provided to Bahrain and Turkey would be sufficient to stabilise Yemen’s economy and avert famine .
	•	Cease expulsions of Yemeni workers:  Saudi Arabia should stop deporting Yemeni expatriates and consider easing taxes and fees on them to preserve remittances .
	•	Stop printing currency and restore hydrocarbon production:  The Yemeni government must halt inflationary financing and focus on reviving oil and gas exports .
	•	Enhance transparency and curb corruption:  Prime Minister Maeen Abdulmalik should implement transparency mechanisms, investigate corruption allegations and cut excessive spending .
	•	Integrate import financing:  Plans to regulate the currency market by speeding up trader qualification and collaborating with banks must be paired with CBY reunification to be effective .

Takeaways and insights
	1.	Currency collapse, not war alone, drives famine:  The article emphasises that famine is primarily due to the currency’s collapse, which is a consequence of policy choices, not an inevitable outcome of war.  Stabilising the rial is therefore central to saving lives.
	2.	Political will matters:  Reunifying the CBY and providing financial support are achievable if parties and their backers prioritise humanitarian needs over political goals.  The editorial asserts that failing to act makes them responsible for mass starvation .
	3.	Remittances are vital:  Expulsion of Yemeni workers from Saudi Arabia undermines the primary source of foreign currency; reversing this policy could ease the currency crisis.
	4.	Inflationary spending exacerbates crisis:  Printing new money to pay salaries without revenue backing accelerates depreciation; restoring oil and gas exports and curbing corruption offer more sustainable solutions.
	5.	Limited authority of Aden CBY:  Without reunification, the Aden-based CBY’s attempts to regulate the currency and provide import financing will remain ineffective because it lacks control over the majority of financial institutions .

	•	Concepts added – Importance of remittances, Gulf economic aid comparisons (Bahrain and Turkey), and linking humanitarian crisis to currency collapse.
	•	Continuity – This editorial builds on earlier warnings about currency depreciation and the need for a unified central bank.

Article 9 – Revitalizing Yemen’s Banking Sector: Necessary Steps for Restarting Formal Financial Cycles and Basic Economic Stabilization (February 2019)

Context and Purpose

By early 2019, Yemen’s banking system was on the verge of collapse.  The ongoing civil war had not only divided control of the country but also split the central bank itself.  President Hadi’s September 2016 decision to move the Central Bank of Yemen (CBY) headquarters from Houthi‑controlled Sana’a to interim capital Aden created two rival central banks with competing jurisdictions, staffs and policy preferences .  Both branches lacked the capacity to perform core functions; Sana’a retained the bulk of trained staff and financial archives yet no longer had foreign reserves or international recognition , while Aden held international recognition but lacked institutional memory and technical expertise .  This report—authored by Farea al‑Muslimi for the Development Champions Forum—diagnoses the structural problems plaguing Yemen’s banks and proposes a roadmap for restoring formal financial cycles.

Key Challenges Facing Yemen’s Banks

Prolonged liquidity crisis and loss of public confidence

• Economic collapse and depleted reserves:  After oil exports halted in 2015—the government’s primary revenue source—Yemen entered a precipitous decline in economic activity .  To fund public spending, the CBY drew down domestic currency reserves and used foreign reserves to finance imports .  The bank sought to preserve foreign exchange by limiting local access, and commercial banks limited withdrawals .

• Run on banks:  These policies, combined with a coalition‑imposed financial blockade, spooked depositors.  In the first six months of 2016, customers withdrew roughly YR300 billion (~US$1.2 billion) from their accounts, sending huge sums into the informal cash economy .  Without liquidity, commercial banks could not deposit funds at the CBY.  The Sana’a‑based CBY began re‑issuing damaged notes and eventually suspended salary payments to 1.2 million public employees in September 2016 because there was not enough physical cash .  Foreign reserves were also nearly exhausted .

A divided central bank

• Dual administrations:  The Aden branch lacked staff, archives and institutional capacity; the Sana’a branch retained personnel but had no reserves or external recognition .  The split created divergent monetary policies that hindered efforts to manage liquidity and undermined confidence in formal banking.  The two banks occasionally issued conflicting regulations, and commercial banks struggled to navigate the competing mandates.

• Frozen assets and public debt:  Funds deposited before September 2016 became stuck in limbo.  Both central banks restricted cash withdrawals to deposits made after the split; pre‑split balances could only be used to transfer balances within the system .  Public debt repayments were suspended; banks’ treasury bills and Islamic sukuk matured but were converted into uncashable accounts .  The Aden CBY later raised interest rates and issued new debt instruments, but required banks to purchase them in cash—effectively preventing the reallocation of existing balances .

Deterioration of the Yemeni rial

• Currency collapse:  The report notes that by late 2018 the rial had lost almost two‑thirds of its value since March 2015, plunging from YR215 per US$1 to a low above YR800 per US$1 in October 2018 .  Rapid devaluations prompted savers to withdraw rials and convert them into dollars or Saudi riyals on the black market , further draining liquidity from banks.  Banks with greater foreign currency liabilities suffered losses, whereas some with reserves speculated on exchange rates .

Competing financial and monetary control

• Rival import financing schemes:  To restore formal trade flows, the Aden CBY developed a framework using a $2 billion Saudi deposit to finance five essential commodities (rice, wheat, milk, sugar and cooking oil).  Decree 75 (September 2018) attempted to regulate fuel and commodity imports .  However, disputes between the central banks prevented banks from fully utilizing this framework .

• Houthi vs. Aden directives:  The Aden CBY required letters of credit to be opened in Aden and funded with cash deposits, but Houthi authorities ordered banks to use checks to guarantee imports .  Houthi authorities threatened bank executives with imprisonment for complying with Aden’s directives and even detained senior staff at Tadhamon International Islamic Bank and al‑Kuraimi Microfinance Bank .  This climate of coercion undermined trust and prompted banks to rely on informal cash networks.

• Restrictions on cash movement and new banknotes:  In December 2018, Houthi authorities capped cash transfers out of their territory at YR450,000 (≈US$900), forcing banks to use risky and expensive smuggling routes .  They also tried to block the circulation of new banknotes printed in Aden, contributing to a liquidity shortage; more than 90 % of the old banknotes were deemed damaged .  Banknote circulation outside the formal banking sector more than doubled between 2014 and 2017—from YR810.9 billion to YR1.67 trillion—and most of the population in Houthi‑held areas continued to rely on cash .

• SWIFT and correspondent banking:  International banking restrictions exacerbated the crisis.  After the CBY split, the SWIFT network was deactivated in September 2016 and only reinstated in April 2017.  Even after reactivation, foreign currency reserves were depleted and international banks refused to interact with Yemeni institutions .  The Aden CBY has resumed SWIFT operations but cannot fully ease restrictions because Yemen fails to meet global anti‑money‑laundering standards .  Furthermore, the Saudi‑led coalition’s limits on foreign currency transfers prevent banks from using their own hard currency reserves to finance imports .

Recommendations for Revitalization

The policy brief proposes a multi‑faceted strategy, highlighting that reunifying the CBY is the most urgent priority.  It stresses that the UN and international community should pressure all parties to facilitate reunification and threaten sanctions against spoilers .  Other recommendations include:
	1.	Reactivate anti‑money‑laundering and counter‑terrorism financing mechanisms:  The CBY’s Financial Information Unit and Yemen’s national AML committee should be restored and neutral, facilitating information exchange with global partners .
	2.	Release banks’ retained balances:  Re‑activate the central bank’s clearing house so banks can use their frozen pre‑2016 deposits to meet urgent customer needs and pay government dues .  The Aden CBY should release banks’ foreign currency balances and facilitate transfers abroad to finance imports .
	3.	Facilitate secure transfers of cash holdings:  Establish safe channels (including UN‑escorted flights) for moving domestic and foreign currency between Sana’a and Aden .  Implement the November 2018 agreement with the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency to move foreign currency out of Yemen .
	4.	Ease import financing requirements and create a cash‑clearing system:  Allow banks to use a defined share of their frozen balances to underwrite letters of credit for essential imports and set up a cash‑clearing system to reduce the costs of moving banknotes across frontlines .
	5.	Replace damaged banknotes:  Replace old, damaged rial notes and mediate between the rival CBYs to ensure new notes circulate throughout Yemen .
	6.	Restart partial servicing of public debt:  Begin cash payments on accrued interest to commercial and Islamic banks and eventually pay down principal once fiscal conditions improve .

Takeaways and Insights
	•	This 2019 policy brief shows that Yemen’s banking collapse was not inevitable—it resulted from political decisions (central bank relocation, conflicting regulations, and weaponisation of currency) interacting with economic shocks.  The mass withdrawal of deposits, the inability to print or distribute cash, and the divergence of monetary policies eroded trust and forced Yemenis into informal markets.
	•	The report underscores that without a unified, competent central bank, technical fixes—such as import financing mechanisms—cannot function.  Rival authorities not only issue inconsistent rules but also intimidate bank staff, exacerbating risk.  Reconstruction of Yemen’s economy thus hinges on resolving the political stalemate.
	•	Importantly, the policy brief recognises that external factors contribute to the crisis.  International sanctions, correspondent banking restrictions and coalition limits on foreign currency transfers hinder banks from performing basic functions.  Reintegrating Yemen into the global financial system will require both domestic reforms and external support.

Article 10 – Yemen Economic Bulletin: The War for Monetary Control Enters a Dangerous New Phase (January 21 2020)

Context and Purpose

By early 2020 Yemen’s currency war had escalated into a full‑blown battle between two central banks.  Since September 2016 the Central Bank of Yemen (CBY) has existed in two competing branches—Aden (internationally‑recognized government) and Sana’a (Houthi‑controlled).  This article traces how the conflict over monetary policy intensified when the Sana’a branch banned newly‑printed banknotes from Aden and attempted to create a parallel electronic currency (the e‑Rial).  It examines the history of the currency war, regional enforcement of the banknote ban, the rise of black‑market trading, divergent exchange rates and the humanitarian toll.  The analysis also looks at how the Aden government responded, the impact on business and humanitarian transfers, and the looming threat of rapid currency depreciation .

Historical Backdrop: Fracturing of Monetary Policy

• Early fractures:  Following the Houthi takeover of Sana’a in September 2014 and subsequent civil war, frontlines hardened into a rough north–south divide.  Economic collapse ensued; by mid‑2016 around YR300 billion (US$1.2 billion) left the banking system as wealthy Yemenis and traders withdrew cash to the informal market .  Oil exports were suspended in 2015, depriving the CBY of its main foreign currency source .  Foreign reserves fell from US$4.6 billion (2014) to US$700 million by September 2016 .

• CBY relocation:  On September 18 2016, President Hadi ordered the CBY headquarters relocated to Aden, splitting the institution across frontlines .  The Aden branch inherited international recognition and the right to print money, while the Sana’a branch retained most staff, archives and control of Yemen’s largest markets .  The two branches have since fought over authority to regulate money supply, import financing, banks, and money exchangers .

• Expansionary monetary policy:  Beginning in January 2017, the Aden CBY imported new banknotes from Russia (YR200 billion initially) and continued printing through 2018, raising the money supply by roughly 53 percent .  By late 2019 some YR1.7 trillion in new Aden‑issued notes had been printed, according to Yemeni banking officials .  The World Bank noted that the mass issuance of new bills caused exchange rate instability: the rial depreciated from YR215/USD (2014) to YR516/USD (late 2018) .

• Initial ban on new bills (June 2017):  The Houthi‑run National Salvation Government prohibited the new YR500 notes printed in Aden from circulating in Houthi‑controlled areas .  Motivation included mitigating inflation caused by Aden’s expansionary policy and retaining control over the country’s largest currency market in Sana’a .  Houthi authorities convened repeated meetings with banks and money exchange outlets—many headquartered in Sana’a—to instruct them to refuse new notes and set aside any discovered bills for confiscation .

• Enforcement campaigns (2017–2019):  The Ministry of Industry and Trade ordered importers, wholesalers, malls and fuel stations not to deal with new YR500 and YR1,000 bills .  By mid‑December 2019 Houthi seizures of banned bills totaled over YR600 million .  The restrictions created a dual exchange rate, with the rial marginally stronger in Houthi‑controlled areas; the exchange rate differential varied between YR5 and YR15 .

Blanket banknote ban and e‑Rial (December 18 2019)

• Directive:  On December 18 2019, the Sana’a CBY issued a circular formally banning all Aden‑printed Yemeni rial banknotes and gave residents one month to trade them in .  The directive allowed exchanges for either old bills (pre‑Sept 2016) or electronic currency (e‑Rial) through specified service providers .  Those caught with new bills after January 17 2020 faced confiscation and possible imprisonment .

• Service providers:  The approved e‑Rial agents included M Floos (Al Kuraimi Islamic Microfinance Bank), Mobile Money (Cooperative & Agricultural Credit Bank), and Quality Connect (jointly owned by Yemen Kuwait Bank, Swaid & Sons Exchange and Al Akwaa Exchange) .  Customers could also exchange up to YR100,000 for old bills at these locations .  Unbanked Yemenis could receive in‑kind transfers (phone credit) instead of e‑Rials .  Previously confiscated new bills were to be converted into e‑Rials .

• Previous experiments:  The ban followed earlier Houthi attempts to decouple from Aden liquidity.  In April 2017 the authorities issued vouchers to cover basic foodstuffs for unpaid public employees; the scheme collapsed as merchants could not redeem vouchers for cash, leading to depreciation and a two‑tier price system .  In March 2018 the Houthis piloted an electronic currency and expanded it in April 2019 to pay Yemen Petroleum Company staff .  However, the e‑Rial remained limited to paying utility bills and phone services and lacked infrastructure for everyday transactions .  Only 6 percent of Yemenis held bank accounts pre‑conflict, making adoption difficult .

Regional enforcement and market reaction

• Uneven implementation:  Enforcement was strict in Sana’a and nearby governorates; businesses there stopped accepting new notes, leaving residents unable to purchase essentials like food, fuel and medicine .  In front‑line and mixed territories (Ibb, Taiz, Al‑Dhalea, Hudaydah, Al‑Jawf), new notes accounted for 60–70 percent of circulation, so a total ban was not enforced .  Houthi fighters in these areas received waivers.

• Black‑market arbitrage:  Only about 10 percent of new banknotes were surrendered during the grace period .  Many turned to black markets, trading new bills for old ones at a discount (e.g., YR10,000 new for YR9,000 old in Hudaydah) .  In Al‑Dhalea goods pricing reflected currency type, with old notes valued 1.10–1.12 times new ones .  Money transfer fees between government and Houthi areas surged from under 1 percent to roughly 12 percent .

• Divergent exchange rates:  By December 31 2019 the exchange rate was YR582/USD in Sana’a vs. YR612/USD in Aden—a 5 percent difference .  After the ban, new rials flowed into government areas, widening the gap; on January 14 2020, Aden’s rate reached YR655/USD compared to YR590/USD in Sana’a (11 percent differential) .  This dynamic increased profits for currency smuggling and arbitrage: traders could buy foreign currency in Houthi areas and sell it at a premium in Aden .

Response from Aden

• Official stance:  On December 22 the Aden CBY dismissed Sana’a’s ban, urging banks, businesses and money exchangers to continue using new banknotes .  It also restricted banks’ issuance of e‑Rials to 15 percent of their capital (capping potential e‑Rials at around YR5 billion) .

• Salary payments halted:  The Yemeni Ministry of Finance announced on December 30 that it could no longer transfer salaries and pensions to northern areas because banks refused to accept new bills .  Normally around YR12 billion per month reached roughly 1.25 million public employees and 40,000 pensioners through Al Kuraimi Islamic Microfinance Bank .  The government would now incur a 10 percent fee for any transfers to Houthi territories .  Some officials suspected that liquidity issues related to the near‑exhausted US$2 billion Saudi deposit (granted in 2018) made the ban a convenient pretext for ending payments .

• Foreign support running low:  By early 2020 the Aden CBY’s foreign currency reserves had fallen to about US$300 million, despite Saudi Arabia providing US$2.4 billion in foreign currency support and fuel grants since 2018 .  The Aden CBY relied on this support to underwrite imports and pay salaries, so dwindling reserves heightened the risk of rapid currency depreciation .

Economic and Social Implications

• Shrinkage of monetary supply:  The ban reduces physical cash in northern regions, squeezing consumer purchasing power in a country where inflation has already quadrupled prices since 2014 .  Small‑denomination notes (YR100, YR200) are deteriorating or scarce , compounding difficulties for day‑to‑day transactions.

• Business relocation:  Growing costs and risks in Houthi‑controlled areas have pushed some traders to move warehouses and operations to Aden or Marib .  Others use gold or goods to circumvent currency restrictions: they buy goods in government areas with new rials and sell them in northern areas for old notes or foreign currency .  Hard currencies (US dollars, Saudi riyals) are increasingly used for cross‑frontline transactions .

• Pressure on Aden:  An influx of new rials into government areas triggers inflation, depreciating the currency relative to the north .  As foreign reserves dwindle, the Aden CBY’s ability to defend the rial weakens, increasing the likelihood of further depreciation and heightened humanitarian hardship .

Legal and Regulatory Actions

Date & Measure	Issuing Authority	Purpose & Implications

Insights and Takeaways
	•	Weaponization of currency:  The article demonstrates how currency supply has become a tool of warfare.  The Houthi ban and e‑Rial scheme aimed to neutralize Aden’s monetary leverage and assert control over northern markets, while the Aden government leveraged international recognition to print money and finance imports.  Ordinary Yemenis suffer the costs through loss of purchasing power, scarcity of small change, and restrictions on salary payments and remittances.
	•	Rise of informal finance:  The war for monetary control has empowered money exchangers and informal networks, which mediate cross‑frontline transfers and supply old notes.  Microfinance institutions like Al Kuraimi and CAC Bank are caught between the two authorities, facing coercion and compliance dilemmas.  Sanctions (e.g., later U.S. FTO designations) and de‑risking by international banks further push finance underground.
	•	International support is finite:  Foreign deposits and grants keep the Aden CBY afloat, but reserves are dwindling.  Without political settlement and unified policy, printing more money accelerates inflation, while bans and e‑Rial experiments aggravate scarcity in the north.  The article foreshadows the mounting pressure on both sides as currency divergence deepens and humanitarian conditions deteriorate.

This in‑depth analysis adds a more granular understanding of the actors (banks, exchangers, microfinance institutions), laws and regulations, and regional variations in enforcement.  The accumulative knowledge base now captures not only names and dates but also the dynamic interplay of policy decisions, market reactions, and socio‑economic impacts.  Subsequent deliverables will continue expanding this log, enriching it with information on microfinance, sanctions, international support and regulatory developments across Yemen’s financial landscape.

Article 11 – Yemen Economic Bulletin: Lebanon’s Financial Collapse Traps Yemeni Banks’ Money (May 8 2020)

Context and Purpose

Lebanon has long served as a regional banking hub and a critical financial conduit for Yemeni banks and traders.  This bulletin explains how the Lebanese financial crisis of 2019–2020—characterized by a collapsing currency, government debt default and informal capital controls—has trapped hundreds of millions of dollars belonging to Yemeni banks.  Since Yemen’s banks rely on foreign currency deposits abroad to finance imports of essential goods, the inability to access deposits in Beirut threatens to deepen Yemen’s humanitarian crisis.  The paper also outlines possible strategies for Yemeni banks to recover their funds and explores the implications for Yemen’s banking sector, importers, and international partners.

Why Yemeni Banks Turned to Lebanon

• Risk de‑risking drives capital to Lebanon:  Yemen’s high-risk designation by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) in 2015 led Western banks to close correspondent accounts and sever ties with Yemeni banks .  Lebanese banks, notably Bank of Beirut, continued to offer dollarized accounts and high interest rates, attracting Yemeni deposits .  As of October 2019, Yemeni banks held approximately US$240 million in foreign currency deposits in Lebanon—about 20 percent of their total foreign currency holdings .

• Trade financing hub:  Lebanon’s banking system became a vital clearinghouse for financing imports into Yemen.  Lebanese accounts allowed Yemeni importers to avoid currency conversion costs when purchasing goods denominated in US dollars or Saudi riyals .  This reliance deepened after Yemen’s foreign reserves dwindled and the CBY’s ability to support letters of credit shrank .

Lebanon’s Financial Crisis and Capital Controls

• Systemic collapse:  Lebanon’s crisis stemmed from years of mismanagement: a persistent balance of payments deficit, high government borrowing and a “financial engineering” scheme where Banque du Liban offered exorbitant interest rates to local banks for dollar deposits .  This created a Ponzi-like system; when foreign currency inflows fell, banks could no longer honor their obligations .  By late 2019 protests erupted, and banks introduced soft capital controls—limiting withdrawals and banning transfers abroad .  In March 2020 Lebanon defaulted on its sovereign debt for the first time , and the local currency lost more than 50 percent of its value .

• Funds frozen:  These controls trapped Yemeni banks’ deposits.  Yemeni bankers visiting Beirut in early 2020 found they could not withdraw funds; negotiations with Bank of Beirut and Lebanon’s central bank yielded no progress .  One Lebanese analyst suggested Yemeni deposits might never be recovered without a “haircut” (reduction in value) .  Yemeni banks’ inability to access their money undermines confidence, delays shipments and jeopardizes future trade deals  .

Impact on Yemen’s Economy and Banking Sector

Import financing and humanitarian implications

• Commodity imports at risk:  Yemen imports up to 90 percent of its essential food commodities .  Formal banks facilitate these imports by providing letters of credit and foreign currency.  With US$240 million frozen in Lebanon and Yemen’s foreign reserves nearly depleted, banks lack liquidity to finance imports.  Exporters have withheld shipments until unpaid debts are settled, creating delays and higher prices  .

• Depreciation pressure:  Foreign currency shortages could lead to further depreciation of the Yemeni rial, eroding purchasing power and exacerbating food insecurity .  Confidence in Yemeni banks weakens when money is inaccessible; this discourages depositors and raises the risk of further capital flight to informal networks or cash hoarding.

Reliance on informal networks and remittances

• Hawala networks:  As formal channels falter, importers increasingly rely on hawala networks (informal money transfer systems) to obtain foreign currency.  Hawala brokers link Yemeni importers to diaspora remittances and foreign currency sources .  These transactions bypass bank restrictions but carry higher exchange rates and limited oversight, increasing vulnerability to money laundering and terror financing .

• Remittances as lifeline:  Remittances from Yemeni expatriates (mainly in Saudi Arabia) became even more critical for financing imports when oil exports ceased and the CBY’s reserves dwindled .  Money exchange companies and hawala dealers play a larger role in channeling remittances, further marginalizing formal banks .

International support and dwindling reserves

• Saudi deposits and grants:  Saudi Arabia provided a US$2 billion deposit in March 2018 to underwrite letters of credit for five essential commodities and later topped it with US$200 million and fuel grants .  By 2020, less than US$200 million remained from this deposit .  The near‑exhaustion of Saudi support magnifies the significance of funds trapped in Lebanon .  If Riyadh cannot provide similar aid due to falling oil prices and economic strain, Yemeni importers will face even greater challenges accessing foreign currency.

• International actors:  The article notes that donors and organisations like the World Bank, IMF and UN have a stake in unfreezing Yemeni deposits to ensure humanitarian imports continue .  Lebanon’s request for an IMF bailout could present leverage; concessions on Yemeni funds might be tied to such rescue packages .

Proposed Strategies: Negotiation, Persuasion or Litigation

The bulletin outlines three potential avenues for Yemeni banks:
	1.	Negotiation:  Yemeni and Lebanese stakeholders could negotiate a compromise to release a portion of the frozen deposits .  This pragmatic approach acknowledges the reality of Lebanon’s crisis while seeking partial relief for Yemeni banks.
	2.	Persuasion via international pressure:  International organisations and donor countries might press Lebanese authorities to free Yemeni funds, especially as Lebanon seeks an IMF bailout .  By tying concessions to financial rescue packages, Yemeni banks could obtain support for at least some of their deposits.
	3.	Litigation:  As a last resort, Yemeni banks could pursue legal action.  The article cites the case of oil trader IMMS, which sued BankMed in a New York court over a US$1 billion frozen deposit and reached a settlement .  However, litigation is costly and uncertain; therefore, negotiation or international pressure is preferable .

Stakeholders and Sub‑Sectors Impacted

Stakeholder / Entity	Role / Sector	Impact or Action
Yemeni commercial & Islamic banks	Formal banking sector	Deposited ~US$240 million in Lebanon to facilitate imports ; funds frozen under Lebanese capital controls; face liquidity shortages and loss of credibility .
Lebanese banking sector (Bank of Beirut)	Regional banking hub	Hosted Yemeni deposits; enforced withdrawal bans; stands accused of operating a Ponzi‑like scheme ; subject to negotiation or legal action .
Banque du Liban (Lebanon’s central bank)	Monetary authority	Offered high‑interest “financial engineering” products to local banks; central to Lebanon’s crisis ; engages with Yemeni delegation but offers no resolution .
FATF and global financial regulators	International compliance bodies	Elevated Yemen to high-risk status in 2015, leading Western banks to sever ties and pushing Yemeni banks toward Lebanon .
Yemeni importers & traders	Private sector	Depend on foreign currency deposits to finance shipments of food and fuel; shipments delayed and new trade deals jeopardized due to frozen funds .
Money exchangers & hawala networks	Informal finance	Bridge gaps in formal banking; channel remittances and provide foreign currency at higher cost .
Saudi Arabia	External donor	Provided US$2 billion deposit and additional grants to support CBY and imports ; reserves nearly depleted by 2020 .
International financial institutions (IMF, World Bank, UN)	Multilateral organisations	Potential mediators; could leverage Lebanon’s request for assistance to secure release of Yemeni funds .
Yemeni diaspora	Remitters	Send remittances through hawala networks; key source of foreign currency for importers .

Legal and Regulatory Developments

Date & Measure	Issuing Authority	Purpose & Implications
FATF high‑risk designation (2015)	Financial Action Task Force	Elevated Yemen to ‘high risk,’ prompting Western banks to sever correspondent relations; drove Yemeni deposits to Lebanon .
Soft capital controls (Nov 2019)	Lebanese banks	Limited withdrawals and barred transfers abroad ; effectively froze foreign deposits including Yemeni funds.
Lebanon sovereign default (Mar 2020)	Lebanese government	First-ever default on debt ; exacerbated banking crisis and currency collapse.
IMMS lawsuit against BankMed (Nov 2019 – Apr 2020)	Private litigation	Oil trader sued BankMed for US$1 billion; settlement reached ; shows potential legal avenue for recovering deposits.


Insights and Takeaways
	•	Interconnected crises:  The Lebanese collapse exposes how financial shocks in one regional hub can reverberate through Yemen’s already fragile economy.  Because Yemen’s banks lacked other correspondent options due to sanctions and de‑risking, they concentrated deposits in Lebanon—only to find them trapped when that system failed.
	•	Importance of risk diversification:  Yemeni banks’ reliance on a single jurisdiction underscores the need to diversify correspondent relationships (e.g., UAE, Turkey) even at the cost of additional currency conversion fees .  Without diversification, future crises may again freeze critical funds.
	•	Role of international partners:  Donor countries and multilateral institutions can leverage Lebanon’s need for economic rescue to secure the release of Yemeni deposits.  Tying IMF or World Bank aid to concessions on Yemeni funds could open space for negotiation .
	•	Shift toward informal finance:  The inability of banks to access funds strengthens hawala networks and money exchangers.  While these networks ensure imports continue, they also operate outside regulatory frameworks, increasing risks of money laundering and terror financing .

Article 12 – Yemen Economic Bulletin: Using IMF Support to Mitigate Currency Collapse (October 22 2021)

Context and Purpose

By late 2021 the Yemeni rial (YR) was in freefall.  Following a modest recovery after the 2018 currency crisis, the rial had depreciated to more than YR 1,300 per US$1 in areas nominally controlled by the internationally recognised government while remaining around YR 600 per US$1 in Houthi‑controlled areas .  This collapse, driven by dwindling foreign reserves, massive monetary expansion and loss of confidence in Aden‑printed money, triggered price hikes and social unrest and threatened Yemen’s already fragile food security.  At the same time the International Monetary Fund (IMF) allocated roughly US$665 million in Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) to Yemen—part of its global COVID‑19 recovery package—offering a potential lifeline .  This bulletin explains the background to the currency collapse, assesses the government’s capacity to deploy the IMF support, and lays out policy recommendations for stabilising the rial and restoring confidence in Yemen’s banking system.

Historical backdrop: recurrent currency crises

• Bifurcated exchange rates:  Since the CBY split in September 2016, Yemen has operated two de‑facto monetary zones.  Houthi‑controlled areas banned Aden‑printed notes, leading to a stable exchange rate around YR 600/USD; government areas relied on printed cash and foreign deposits, causing the exchange rate to plummet to YR 1,300/USD by mid‑October 2021 .  The disparity reflected divergent policies and resources: Sana’a enjoyed inflows of foreign currency through remittances and trade, while Aden depleted its reserves and printed new money.

• Exhausted foreign reserves:  The Aden‑based CBY had essentially exhausted its foreign currency reserves by late 2021 .  The $2 billion Saudi deposit, which stabilised the rial in 2018–19 by financing imports of wheat, rice, sugar, milk and cooking oil, was nearly spent by the end of 2020, with only US$11.3 million remaining .  Meanwhile remittances—the largest source of Yemen’s foreign currency—declined sharply due to COVID‑19 restrictions .

• Expansionary monetary policy:  To finance government spending, mainly salaries for public servants and security forces, the CBY‑Aden printed vast amounts of money.  The resulting surge in currency supply, combined with foreign currency scarcity, fueled depreciation and inflation .  Houthi advances on the battlefield further undermined confidence in Aden‑issued currency, prompting people in government‑held areas to hoard dollars and Saudi riyals .

IMF allocation and potential impact

The IMF’s August 23 2021 SDR allocation extended US$665 million to Yemen (SDR 466.8 million)  .  Combined with a previous SDR allocation from 2009, Yemen’s net cumulative entitlement reached SDR 699 million (≈US$1 billion) .  SDRs are reserve assets that can be exchanged for convertible currencies through arrangements with other IMF members; likely partners for Yemen include the United States, United Kingdom and Saudi Arabia .  Should bilateral exchanges not materialise, the IMF can designate partners to ensure liquidity .  While the SDR allocation falls far short of Yemen’s financing needs , careful utilisation could stabilise the currency and attract further aid .

Challenges facing effective use of IMF support
	1.	Institutional weakness and corruption:  The CBY‑Aden suffers from weak governance and capacity following its relocation to Aden in 2016.  A UN Panel of Experts report accused the Yemeni government and CBY‑Aden of mismanaging the US$2 billion Saudi deposit and embezzling nearly US$500 million through preferential exchange rates for import financing—allegations later withdrawn but reflecting real opacity and fertile ground for corruption .  The CBY‑Aden’s credibility is undermined by ongoing internal divisions within the anti‑Houthi coalition (e.g., Southern Transitional Council) .
	2.	Limited foreign currency channels:  Since international aid agencies refused to channel funds through CBY‑Aden, the bank struggled to replenish reserves .  With Saudi Arabia reluctant to inject new deposits and remittances down, the CBY had few avenues to access hard currency .
	3.	Extreme humanitarian urgency:  Rapid currency depreciation drove up prices of basic goods and triggered protests across southern and eastern Yemen .  Yemen imports up to 90 percent of its food; thus exchange‑rate stability is vital to prevent famine .

Policy recommendations and proposed mechanisms

The bulletin recommends a two‑phase strategy: immediate measures to stabilise the currency and longer‑term reforms to rebuild financial governance.

Address immediate needs

• Form an Emergency Committee:  Create a temporary committee composed of technocrats from the CBY‑Aden, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Industry and Trade, Economic Committee and other relevant bodies, working in consultation with the IMF .  This committee should design a transparent mechanism to deploy the SDR funds specifically for currency stabilisation in southern and eastern Yemen .

• Abolish preferential exchange rates:  The previous import financing mechanism used a fixed exchange rate lower than market rates, incentivising arbitrage and corruption.  The new scheme should set the import financing rate YR 10 lower than the market weighted average at the time of each deal .  Only staple foods should be financed; sugar, which constitutes about 10 percent of imports and benefits manufacturers more than consumers, should be excluded .

• Limit SDR disbursement:  Access to the IMF funds should be capped initially, with details and transactions published promptly to promote transparency and build confidence .

• Replace CBY‑Aden leadership:  The article calls for replacing the CBY‑Aden governor and board, citing their inability to fulfil the bank’s mandate and eroded trust among domestic and international stakeholders .  Competent technocrats with a public‑service track record should assume these roles, and the Emergency Committee should dissolve once a new board is installed .

Beyond immediate needs

• Develop comprehensive SDR frameworks:  The new CBY leadership, with IMF guidance, should create a coherent plan for deploying Yemen’s SDR allocation.  This includes assessing macroeconomic impacts, prioritising expenditures, and identifying risks associated with misuse or lack of transparency .

• Evaluate import financing functions:  If an import financing mechanism remains necessary, the CBY should adopt a conservative exchange‑rate policy and issue letters of credit (LoCs) at rates close to the prevailing parallel market in each region.  LoC proceeds collected in Houthi areas should go toward paying salaries of public employees there .

• Diversify foreign currency sources:  Yemen must revive domestic revenue streams to reduce dependence on aid.  The bulletin proposes financing development projects to rehabilitate oil and natural gas infrastructure, maintain and expand export pipelines, and improve security conditions to boost production  .

Stakeholders and sub‑sectors impacted

Stakeholder / Entity	Role / Sector	Impact or Action
Central Bank of Yemen (CBY‑Aden)	Government‑controlled monetary authority	Faces loss of foreign reserves and credibility; printed money to cover salaries; must manage SDR deployment; leadership replacement recommended .
Central Bank of Yemen (CBY‑Sana’a)	Houthi‑controlled branch	Benefits from ban on Aden‑printed notes; maintains stable exchange rate; controls large population centres and foreign currency inflows .
International Monetary Fund (IMF)	Multilateral lender	Allocated US$665 million SDRs to Yemen; provides guidelines on SDR use; may facilitate currency exchanges and designate partners .
Saudi Arabia	Gulf donor and coalition leader	Provided a US$2 billion deposit in 2018 to stabilise the currency; deposit nearly exhausted ; reluctant to give more; could be an exchange partner for SDRs.
United States and United Kingdom	Potential SDR exchange partners	Could trade SDRs for hard currency; hold influence in IMF; key donors.
Southern Transitional Council (STC)	Southern separatist faction	Controls Aden and influences CBY‑Aden operations; internal divisions impede unified economic policy .
Economic Committee / Ministry of Finance / Ministry of Industry and Trade	Government policy bodies	Should participate in Emergency Committee; responsible for designing and implementing import financing mechanisms and budgeting .
Importers and traders	Food and commodity dealers	Depend on import financing; previously exploited preferential rates; subject to new rules under proposed mechanism .
Public employees and residents in government‑controlled areas	Salaried workers and consumers	Suffer from currency depreciation and inflation; would benefit from stabilised exchange rate and restored public trust.

Legal and regulatory actions and proposals

Measure or Recommendation	Authority / Source	Purpose & Implications
IMF SDR allocation (Aug 23 2021)	IMF Executive Board	Provided SDR466.8 million (≈US$665 million) to Yemen; part of global COVID‑19 recovery .
Saudi deposit (March 2018)	Saudi Arabia	US$2 billion deposit used by CBY‑Aden to finance imports and stabilise the rial; largely depleted by end 2020 .
Proposed Emergency Committee and reforms	Sana’a Center recommendations	Form technocratic committee; set transparent mechanism for SDR use; end preferential exchange rates; replace CBY‑Aden leadership .
Guidance on import financing	Sana’a Center recommendations	Use market‑weighted rates; exclude sugar; publish deal details to prevent arbitrage .
Long‑term reforms	Sana’a Center recommendations	Develop SDR frameworks; reassert CBY‑Aden regulatory authority; liberalise letter of credit issuance across regions; invest in hydrocarbon infrastructure .


Insights and takeaways
	•	Leadership matters:  Stabilising the Yemeni rial hinges on credible, competent management of the CBY‑Aden.  The article emphasises replacing the current leadership and establishing a technocratic emergency committee to restore confidence .  This signals to donors and markets that reforms are underway, potentially unlocking further support.
	•	Transparency and targeted financing:  The previous Saudi deposit and import financing scheme created opportunities for corruption and arbitrage, undermining the currency’s stability.  The new mechanism must align the import financing rate closely with market rates, exclude non‑staple commodities like sugar, and publish transaction details .  Transparency will deter rent‑seeking and build trust.
	•	Diversification and self‑reliance:  While external financial assistance is crucial, Yemen cannot rely solely on aid.  Reviving oil and gas production, mobilising domestic revenues and fostering cooperation across frontlines will reduce dependence on foreign deposits .
	•	Broader significance:  The currency crisis is symptomatic of Yemen’s fragmented governance and prolonged conflict.  Stabilising the rial requires not only financial management but also political compromises, institutional rebuilding and inclusive economic policies.  The IMF SDR allocation provides a window of opportunity; if squandered, Yemen could slide deeper into hyperinflation and famine.

Article 13 – Yemen Economic Bulletin: The CBY‑Aden’s Crisis of Confidence – Assessing the UN Panel of Experts’ Corruption Allegations (March 26 2021)

Context and Purpose

In January 2021 the United Nations Panel of Experts on Yemen published its annual report accusing the internationally recognised Yemeni government, the Aden‑based Central Bank of Yemen (CBY‑Aden) and major importers of colluding to embezzle roughly US$423 million from a Saudi deposit intended to finance basic food imports.  The panel claimed that the CBY‑Aden offered importers preferential exchange rates well below market rates, enabling them to capture enormous profits while ordinary Yemenis saw no benefit.  This Sana’a Center bulletin scrutinises the panel’s claims, highlighting errors in its evidence and reasoning, and assesses broader issues of transparency and governance at the CBY‑Aden.  It argues that while the specific accusations are flawed, there is indeed a crisis of confidence in the CBY‑Aden that demands urgent reform  .

Background: Yemen’s import financing system

• Pre‑conflict stability:  Prior to 2015, Yemen imported up to 90 percent of its food needs and the CBY maintained a fixed peg of YR 215 per US$1 by judiciously regulating foreign exchange and issuing letters of credit (LCs) to importers .  In 2014, foreign reserves stood at US$5.3 billion and oil and gas exports supplied the bulk of hard currency .

• Seeds of currency diversion:  The war’s eruption in 2015 caused economic collapse and nearly halted oil exports.  The CBY spent almost 40 percent of its reserves financing essential imports in the first half of 2015 .  As reserves dwindled, the bank ended sugar subsidies and devalued the official rate to YR 250/US$1 .  By mid‑2016 the rial traded at over YR 300/USD, prompting the bank’s relocation to Aden and creating two rival central banks .

• Saudi deposit and LC mechanism:  In March 2018 Riyadh deposited US$2 billion at the CBY‑Aden to finance imports of wheat, rice, sugar, milk and cooking oil .  The programme aimed to stabilise the rial and food prices by offering importers letters of credit at a preferential exchange rate below the market rate.  By November 2018 the rial had appreciated from YR 732 to YR 518 per US$1, and food prices fell modestly .

The Panel of Experts’ allegations

• Embezzlement claims:  The panel asserted that between July 2018 and August 2020 the CBY‑Aden offered importers an average LC rate of YR 570/US$1 while the market rate averaged YR 683/US$1, creating a 29 percent differential .  Over 38 LC batches (US$1.89 billion), this allegedly diverted US$423 million to “preferred traders,” notably the Hayel Saeed Anam (HSA) Group, which the panel claimed received 48 percent of the deposit .  The panel also accused Governor Mohammed Zammam and successive CBY leadership of violating Decree 75 (2018) and the Central Bank Law by setting preferential rates and failing to seek maximum returns .

• Impact on Yemenis:  The panel argued that the preferential rates did not lower consumer prices: in 2019 the rial depreciated 23 percent and the minimum food basket price rose 21 percent, with sugar and oil prices soaring .  It concluded that the CBY‑Aden colluded with businesses to launder money and denied Yemenis their right to food .

Evidence gaps and analytical errors

The bulletin identifies significant flaws in the panel’s case:
	1.	Misinterpreting exchange rate trends:  The panel used WFP data covering August 2019 to August 2020 but applied it to 2019.  In reality, the rial stabilised and food prices fell when the LC mechanism disbursed most of the deposit (Nov 2018–Dec 2019).  Rapid depreciation occurred in early 2020 after the Houthi–government monetary split deepened .
	2.	Incorrect calculation of differentials:  Recalculating the panel’s own data shows the average LC rate was YR 469.8/US$1 versus a YR 585.6/US$1 market rate, implying a 24.6 percent differential, not 29 percent.  Moreover, the panel used exchange rates from Houthi areas only; using national averages reduces the estimated arbitrage by about US$76 million .
	3.	Misidentifying beneficiaries:  The panel erroneously included Aden Silos & Mills (owned by the Al Rowaishan Group) as part of HSA Group when calculating its share of the deposit.  Correcting this reduces HSA’s share to 45 percent, not 48 percent .
	4.	Legal misinterpretations:  The panel conflated the CBY’s mandate to maintain price stability with outdated provisions from the 1991 CBY law emphasising profit maximisation.  Law 14 of 2000 prioritises price stability , giving the bank discretion to set exchange rates.  Governor Zammam’s mechanism (average of rates at major banks/exchangers minus YR 10–15) was legally allowed, though poorly monitored .

Salient concerns and systemic issues

Although the panel’s specific accusations falter, the bulletin underscores genuine problems:

• Elite capture and market concentration:  Yemen’s food import market has long been dominated by a few conglomerates.  Decree 75 (2018) limited import financing to five commodities, indirectly granting large traders privileged access to foreign currency and encouraging monopoly .  Competition is further hampered by logistical constraints, Houthi interference and international banking restrictions.

• Lack of oversight and transparency:  Since the CBY relocated to Aden, there have been no comprehensive audits and little public disclosure .  Internal governance is crippled by political infighting and ambiguous authority, with multiple leadership changes and board disputes.

• Currency divergence and humanitarian impact:  The split between CBY‑Aden and CBY‑Sana’a has produced dual exchange rates, undermined price regulation and eroded public trust.  Donors like Saudi Arabia may withhold future support, exacerbating currency depreciation and food insecurity .

Recommendations from the bulletin

For the Yemeni government:
	1.	Dismiss and replace CBY‑Aden leadership:  Remove the entire senior leadership and board, appointing politically unaffiliated technocrats with proven integrity .
	2.	Conduct independent audits and investigations:  Mandate comprehensive audits of all CBY operations and transactions related to the Saudi deposit and foreign currency sales/purchases; publish the results .
	3.	Pursue legal accountability:  Investigate and prosecute current and former CBY governors and board members for any violations of Yemeni law .
	4.	Reform market structure:  Explore policies to reduce oligopolistic tendencies and foster competition in the food import market .

For CBY‑Aden under new leadership:
	1.	Publish Saudi deposit distribution data:  Release detailed information on which importers received funds and in what amounts .
	2.	Strengthen governance and transparency:  Overhaul institutional structures, develop clear monetary policy frameworks and implement accountability measures in the import financing system .
	3.	Adopt a unified managed float:  Eliminate multiple internal exchange rates and adopt a managed float, adjusting interventions based on foreign currency availability and market dynamics .
	4.	Publish financial statements and bulletins:  Resume regular release of financial statements, monthly monetary bulletins and annual reports .

For HSA Group and other major traders:  Conduct independent audits of their participation in the LC mechanism and publish pricing data to demonstrate transparency .

For the UN Panel of Experts:  Correct factual errors, review methodologies and consult Yemeni experts to improve future reports .

Stakeholders and sub‑sectors impacted

CBY‑Sana’a	Houthi‑controlled central bank	Maintains control over most markets; bans Aden‑issued rials; competes with CBY‑Aden, contributing to exchange‑rate divergence.
Hayel Saeed Anam (HSA) Group	Yemen’s largest conglomerate	Alleged by the panel to receive 48 % of Saudi deposit; corrected to 45 %. Should audit its use of LC mechanism and publish pricing data .
Aden Silos & Mills (Al Rowaishan Group)	Food company	Mistakenly included as part of HSA Group; received US$32.5 million via LC mechanism .
Commercial banks & importers	Letters of credit beneficiaries	Benefited from preferential exchange rates; subject to new transparency rules; may face scrutiny if collusion is proven.
UN Panel of Experts on Yemen	UN investigative body	Levelled corruption allegations; criticised for data errors, misinterpretation and lack of Yemeni expertise .
Saudi Arabia	Donor	Provided US$2 billion deposit; potential further support jeopardised by corruption allegations .
Yemeni consumers and public servants	Society at large	Suffer from currency depreciation, inflation and food insecurity; stand to benefit from reforms and renewed confidence.
Ministry of Industry & Trade / Economic Committee	Government policy bodies	Involved in Decree 75 and import financing; urged to foster competition and market reform .

Legal and regulatory actions and proposals

Date & Measure	Authority	Purpose & Implications
March 2018 Saudi deposit	Saudi Arabia & CBY‑Aden	US$2 billion deposit to finance food imports; exchange rate set below market; stabilised rial temporarily .
Decree 75 (Sept 2018)	Yemeni government & CBY‑Aden	Regulated import financing for five basic commodities; inadvertently entrenched oligopoly and allowed arbitrage .
Panel of Experts report (Jan 25 2021)	UN Panel of Experts	Accused CBY‑Aden of money laundering; errors in data and legal interpretation exposed .
Sana’a Center recommendations	Independent analysis	Calls for dismissing CBY‑Aden leadership, audits, unified exchange rate, market reform and transparency .


Insights and takeaways
	•	Evidence matters:  Robust economic analysis must be grounded in accurate data and context.  The UN panel’s miscalculations underscore how erroneous statistics can mislead policy and erode trust.  Independent audits and transparency are essential to restore confidence.
	•	Systemic reform versus scapegoating:  While individual misdeeds should be prosecuted, Yemen’s currency and food crises stem from structural issues: dual central banks, monopolistic import markets, political infighting and inadequate regulation.  Replacing leadership without addressing institutional weaknesses will not suffice.
	•	Transparency and competition:  Publishing detailed data on foreign currency allocations and import financing, auditing major traders, and fostering a competitive market are key to preventing elite capture and ensuring subsidies reach consumers.
	•	International credibility:  Donor confidence hinges on credible, impartial management of aid funds.  Demonstrating responsible use of the Saudi deposit and implementing IMF‑guided reforms (as described in Article 12) can unlock additional support and mitigate humanitarian catastrophe.

Deep‑Dive Analysis: Yemen Economic Bulletin – The Limited Efficacy of US Sanctions on Houthi Financial Networks (December 17 2021)

Context and Purpose of the Bulletin

In December 2021 the Sana’a Center’s Economic Unit examined a series of US sanctions aimed at dismantling the Houthi movement’s financial lifelines.  The bulletin argues that although the sanctions have disrupted some channels, their overall impact has been limited and may unintentionally worsen Yemen’s humanitarian crisis.  Since the war began, de‑risking by international banks and conflict‑induced fragmentation have driven financial flows out of regulated banks into informal hawala networks.  Money exchange companies became pivotal players; among them Swaid & Sons grew into one of Yemen’s largest exchange houses, operating across the country and internationally .

The article traces the United States’ escalating sanctions campaign in 2021.  In January 2021 the outgoing Trump administration announced it would designate the Houthi movement (Ansar Allah) as a Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO) .  Humanitarian agencies and lawmakers warned that such a designation would obstruct aid to the majority of Yemenis living under Houthi control.  President Biden revoked the FTO listing in February  but Washington continued to sanction Houthi commanders and financiers individually .  By mid‑2021 the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) broadened its focus beyond the Houthis’ military leadership to their economic foundations, targeting a smuggling network led by Sa’id Ahmad Muhammad al‑Jamal (based in Iran) and the money‑exchange giant Swaid & Sons .

How Swaid & Sons Became Yemen’s Financial Powerhouse

The bulletin dedicates a large section to tracing Swaid & Sons’ evolution from a textile shop in Sana’a into a money‑market empire.  Founder Mohammed Lotf Swaid launched his first exchange shop in 1998; by 2008 the company was legally registered as a multi‑partner money exchange and transfer house .  As Yemen’s banking system began disintegrating after 2015, Swaid & Sons expanded rapidly by:
	•	Developing digital transfer networks:  The company created the Floosak electronic money service and Mal Money Transfer, linking it to exchangers nationwide and to major firms such as MoneyGram and Western Union .
	•	Leveraging regulatory gaps:  Yemen’s cash‑based economy and the 2016 split of the Central Bank of Yemen (CBY) into rival offices in Aden and Sana’a eroded regulatory oversight .  Unlicensed exchangers proliferated, and hawala networks filled the void as banks lost correspondent services .  Swaid’s networks became indispensable to commercial traders and even banks seeking rial liquidity or hard currency .
	•	Acting as a clearing house:  By 2016–20 Swaid & Sons handled at least 20% of Yemen’s foreign currency trading .  Banks and businesses relied on it to access foreign exchange and transfer funds, often at high premiums.

The firm’s nationwide network allowed the Houthi authorities to shift old banknotes from government‑controlled areas into Houthi territory after their ban on newly printed rials (December 2019).  This helped the CBY‑Sana’a capture scarce old notes, while government areas were flooded with new, depreciating currency .

Sanctions Against the Smuggling Network and Swaid & Sons

OFAC’s June 10 2021 update to its Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) list targeted twelve members of al‑Jamal’s smuggling network, including Syrians, Turks, and Emirati‑registered companies, as well as Swaid & Sons .  The Treasury said al‑Jamal smuggled Iranian fuel and commodities to customers across the Middle East and Asia, with tens of millions of dollars funneled through Swaid & Sons to finance the Houthis and Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps–Quds Force .  Businessmen in this network included Hani ‘Abd‑al‑Majid Muhammad As’ad (al‑Jamal’s accountant in Turkey) and various companies (Adoon General Trading FZE, and others) .

Domestic reactions and enforcement challenges

The sanctions triggered rapid responses inside Yemen but enforcement proved patchy:
	•	Government‑led freeze orders:  The Aden‑based Public Prosecution Office (PPO) issued Decree 15 adding sanctioned entities to a domestic terrorism list.  The CBY‑Aden directed banks and exchange houses to freeze Swaid’s accounts and revoke its licenses .
	•	Industry opposition:  The Sana’a‑based Yemeni Money Exchange Association condemned the US sanctions and called for their cancellation, warning of harm to the broader financial sector .
	•	Ignored directives:  Despite the decree, most Yemeni banks and financial actors (largely headquartered in Sana’a) faced Houthi pressure to ignore the sanctions.  Only Swaid’s branch in Marib was closed; the company’s nationwide Mal network continued operations, and no comprehensive asset freeze occurred .
	•	Loss of correspondence:  Major international transfer companies (MoneyGram, Western Union, Xpress Money) severed ties with Swaid, damaging its reputation and limiting its formal access to global financial systems .  Yet the firm continued to operate internationally via hawala networks and by serving as an agent for license‑holding banks .

The bulletin notes that Swaid held only one known foreign bank account (US$20 million in Oman), which had been frozen before the June sanctions .  Many of its overseas funds were held via correspondent networks in the UAE and Saudi Arabia; thus the direct impact on its foreign assets appears limited .

Sanctions’ Broader Impact on the Houthi Movement

The bulletin argues that current sanctions are unlikely to dismantle the Houthis’ financing networks:
	•	Assets beyond reach:  Al‑Jamal’s network and similar schemes likely keep significant assets outside US jurisdiction, limiting direct vulnerability to asset freezes .
	•	Learning from allies:  The Houthis can draw on coping strategies developed by Lebanese Hezbollah and Iran, which have long operated under sanctions .
	•	Self‑reliant financing:  As a de facto government, the Houthi movement controls state institutions, collects taxes and customs, and extracts resources from local populations.  Iranian support continues via subsidized fuel and arms smuggling through Omani and Somali routes .  These informal channels are difficult to monitor and have proven resilient .
	•	War economy expansion:  Yemen’s war economy has spawned a black market of dubious transfer networks and speculative currency traders, making sanctions easier to evade .  The FTO revocation also eased compliance burdens for businesses interacting with Houthis, limiting pressure on their financing .

Looking Ahead: Balancing Sanctions with Humanitarian Needs

Sanctions can worsen Yemen’s humanitarian crisis by hampering foreign trade and increasing compliance costs:
	•	Humanitarian dependence on imports:  Roughly 90% of Yemen’s food is imported, and 20.7 million people need humanitarian assistance .  Sanctions that disrupt trade or raise transaction costs can inflate prices and exacerbate famine.
	•	De‑risking by global banks:  Foreign banks often implement over‑compliance measures, effectively severing Yemeni businesses from global finance .  This drives more money into informal markets, undermining efforts to stabilize the rial and finance legitimate trade.
	•	Monitoring and strategy:  The article calls for a monitoring system to assess sanctions’ effects on the financial sector, humanitarian conditions and political dynamics .  Without a comprehensive strategy responsive to local market realities, sanctions risk deepening economic fragmentation and human suffering .

Key Takeaways
	1.	Informal networks rule:  The collapse of Yemen’s banking system and international de‑risking have enabled money exchange companies like Swaid & Sons to dominate financial flows.  These networks operate beyond the reach of formal regulators, complicating sanctions enforcement.
	2.	Sanctions have limited bite:  OFAC designations damaged Swaid & Sons’ formal international relationships and spurred domestic freeze decrees, but the company continues to operate through hawala networks and under Houthi protection .  The smuggling network’s assets are largely outside US jurisdiction , and the Houthis remain financially resilient.
	3.	Humanitarian risks:  Yemen imports nearly all its food.  Sanctions that impede trade or increase compliance costs risk exacerbating famine and poverty.  Monitoring systems must track how sanctions affect the economy and humanitarian landscape .
	4.	Need for strategic coherence:  Sanctions should form part of a broader plan that also addresses currency stability, CBY reunification and the informal financial sector.  Without alignment, economic fragmentation may intensify and prolong the conflict.

The article shows the CBY remains split; the currency war intensified when CBY-Sana’a banned new notes (2019). Sanctions have not addressed this fundamental divide, indicating limited progress.
Regulating Money Exchangers (2019)	Calls to regulate exchangers and integrate them into formal systems.	The proliferation of hawala networks and Swaid & Sons’ dominance indicates regulation remains weak. CBY-Aden’s attempt to revoke licenses was largely ignored due to Houthi pressure .
Diversifying Public Revenues	Past policy briefs recommended reducing reliance on oil and customs by expanding taxation and fostering microfinance.	The article does not mention significant diversification. Houthi authorities instead extract revenues through smuggling and taxation in controlled areas .
Monitoring Sanctions Effects	Several analyses call for assessing sanctions’ humanitarian impact before implementation.	The bulletin reiterates this need, highlighting that sanctions risk worsening humanitarian crises unless accompanied by monitoring and tailored strategies .
International Support to CBY & Financial Sector	Repeated recommendations for Saudi deposits, IMF SDR utilisation and donor coordination.	No new deposits or major financial support are noted in this article. Instead, the focus is on US sanctions, indicating that foreign aid flows remain insufficient to stabilise the rial or restore banking confidence.


Financial & Banking Series – Article 15 (2020)

Overview

This deliverable examines the November 27 2020 Yemen Economic Bulletin “Battle to Regulate Banks Threatens to Rupture the Financial Sector” from the Sana’a Center for Strategic Studies.  The piece chronicles how the rivalry between the two central banks – the internationally recognised Central Bank of Yemen in Aden (CBY‑Aden) and the Houthi‑controlled Central Bank in Sana’a (CBY‑Sana’a) – escalated into an open battle for control over banks’ operational data, threatening to fracture the formal financial sector.  It details the competing decrees issued by both banks, the coercive tactics used by authorities, the humanitarian implications of the standoff, and the urgent need for third‑party mediation.  This summary contextualises those events within Yemen’s broader economic collapse and updates the cumulative knowledge base with new actors, regulations and events.

Key findings and chronology

1. Escalation of the data war
	•	Competing demands for banking data:  In early 2020 the CBY‑Sana’a banned banks from sharing data with CBY‑Aden, while CBY‑Aden demanded complete access to bank records to monitor compliance with anti‑money‑laundering regulations and manage foreign currency auctions.  Because 17 of Yemen’s 18 banks and most exchange companies are headquartered in Sana’a, the CBY‑Sana’a retained physical control over banking records and could enforce its ban.  CBY‑Aden, lacking such leverage, threatened punitive measures for non‑compliance and referred three banks – the International Bank of Yemen (IBY), Yemen Kuwait Bank (YKB) and Yemen Bank for Reconstruction & Development (YBRD) – to public prosecution .
	•	Use of coercion:  Houthi authorities closed branches of Al‑Kuraimi Islamic Microfinance Bank in March 2020 to force the bank to halt data sharing.  The bank reopened only after paying fines and pledging to stop providing information to Aden .  CBY‑Aden responded by levying fines on banks and threatening to suspend SWIFT access for non‑compliant institutions.  Some branches were told they could only reopen if they agreed to refrain from sharing data with Aden .
	•	Yemen Banks Association (YBA) mediation:  The YBA attempted to mediate, initially threatening partial strikes and eventually offering a compromise whereby banks would share data on transactions in government‑controlled areas while CBY‑Aden would suspend prosecutions .  This compromise was not accepted by either central bank, leaving the standoff unresolved.

2. Humanitarian and economic impacts
	•	Aid flows and humanitarian risk:  The banks targeted by CBY‑Aden – IBY, YKB, YBRD, Al‑Kuraimi and Tadhamon International Islamic Bank – handle most UN and NGO foreign aid flows.  According to ACAPS estimates, roughly 80 % of humanitarian funds in 2018 flowed through banks based in Houthi‑controlled areas .  The standoff therefore threatened to disrupt cash‑based aid distribution and humanitarian import financing, exacerbating the ongoing food insecurity and medical shortages.  International donors deposit foreign currency in offshore accounts; the banks then convert it to rials and distribute locally.  Without cooperation between the two CBYs, this system cannot function effectively. 
	•	Liquidity crisis and inflation:  Yemen’s financial sector was already strained by foreign currency shortages, declining remittances, exhaustion of Saudi deposits, and the impact of the Southern Transitional Council’s (STC) self‑rule declaration in 2020 .  With both CBY branches printing money to fund deficits and refusing to coordinate, the rial continued to depreciate and reliance on unregulated exchange markets grew.  The standoff over data worsened these dynamics by pushing transactions further into informal networks and raising the risk of bank runs.

3. Future scenarios and recommendations
	•	Potential escalations:  The article outlines several possible developments.  CBY‑Aden could move YBRD’s headquarters to Aden (as it did previously with the Cooperative & Agricultural Credit Bank, CAC Bank).  It might also suspend SWIFT access for the non‑compliant banks.  Meanwhile CBY‑Sana’a is likely to continue blocking data sharing to undermine CBY‑Aden’s oversight, which would deepen the division and accelerate the creation of two parallel financial systems .
	•	Need for third‑party mediation:  Without intervention from international stakeholders (UN Special Envoy, the Yemen Quad, European Union, World Bank, IMF, Islamic Development Bank and Gulf donors), the economic conflict will continue.  The article calls for the creation of a new mediation framework to facilitate information sharing, unify monetary policy and protect humanitarian funds .  A failure to act will push Yemen closer to famine and irreparably damage its banking sector.

Analysis and takeaways
	1.	Banking sector fragmentation:  This article illustrates how economic war tactics have shifted from direct military confrontation to institutional sabotage.  By competing over control of bank data, the rival CBYs turned financial regulation into a weapon.  The consequence is a dual banking system where depositors’ trust erodes and informal money‑changer networks expand – trends that were already noted in earlier articles from 2016–18 and continue into 2020.
	2.	Aid as a battlefield:  Because the targeted banks process humanitarian funds, the data conflict directly jeopardises relief efforts.  Sanctions and designations (discussed in the December 2021 article) already forced international banks to de‑risk.  Now domestic institutions risk paralysis due to political manoeuvring.  This underscores the need to ring‑fence humanitarian finance from economic warfare.
	3.	Reinforcement of earlier trends:  The article confirms previous warnings (2016 – 2019) that splitting the central bank and printing new money would undermine monetary stability.  By 2020 this had escalated into mutual sabotage.  The standoff is a symptom of a larger failure to establish a unified regulatory framework; thus, solutions must address not only bank data sharing but also currency supply, debt servicing, and regulatory cooperation.
	4.	International leverage:  External actors have leverage to incentivise cooperation (e.g., linking aid disbursement to compliance, providing technical assistance for data sharing, or conditioning access to foreign currency auctions).  However, as seen in later articles (2024–2025), sustained donor support is dwindling, making a durable resolution urgent.

Builds on earlier mention of CBY governors and board members (articles 1–4); extends the list of banks beyond those previously discussed (e.g., CAC Bank). Demonstrates the growing prominence of microfinance and commercial banks in humanitarian finance (link to microfinance brief, article 16).
Regulations & decrees	CBY‑Sana’a ban on data sharing (Jan 2020); CBY‑Aden fines and prosecutions; closure orders by Houthi authorities; YBA mediation proposal to share data only for transactions in government areas.	Follows earlier regulatory history: relocation of CBY (2016), printing of new notes (2017–2019), ban on new notes (2020). Reinforces the trend toward conflicting monetary decrees (articles 6, 10).
Events	Closure of Al‑Kuraimi branches and subsequent reopening; referral of IBY, YKB and YBRD to prosecution; proposed relocation of YBRD HQ to Aden; ACAPS estimate that 80 % of humanitarian aid flows through banks in Houthi areas ; continued printing of currency by both CBYs.	Adds to the timeline of monetary and institutional crises (currency collapse in 2017, e‑Rial introduction in 2020). Shows escalation of economic warfare beyond currency to data control.
Policies & recommendations	Urges creation of a new mediation framework involving UN, EU, IMF, etc.; calls for separation of humanitarian funds from political disputes; suggests that donors should use their leverage to encourage cooperation; warns that failure will accelerate rial depreciation and deepen humanitarian crisis .	Echoes earlier recommendations to reunify the central bank (articles 7–8) and to use international aid strategically (articles 9–10). Highlights continuity and divergence in policy suggestions across the series.

The November 2020 bulletin underscores how Yemen’s central banking schism has evolved into a direct contest for control over banking data.  This contest exacerbates monetary instability, undermines humanitarian finance and deepens public distrust in formal financial institutions.  It reveals that without an immediate, internationally backed mediation mechanism and clear legal frameworks, the rivalry between the two CBYs will push Yemen’s economy closer to collapse and hinder any future recovery.  The article is thus a critical bridge in the financial‑banking series, linking earlier currency‑collapse narratives to the later analyses of sanctions, microfinance challenges, and fiscal crises

This deliverable provides an in‑depth analysis of the March 2 2023 Sana’a Center policy brief “Bridging the Divide: Mitigating the Impacts of the CBY Schism on Yemen’s Banking Sector.”  Written for the Yemen International Forum 2022, the brief examines how the rivalry between Yemen’s two central banks has fractured the banking sector, created dual currencies, politicized import financing and accelerated the growth of informal financial networks.  It offers targeted recommendations for bridging the divide and protecting banks from the wider war economy.  This summary contextualizes the brief within the financial‑banking series and updates the cumulative knowledge log.

Key findings and chronology

1. Roots of the crisis
	•	Cash‑based economy and pre‑war vulnerabilities:  Before 2014 Yemen had a largely cash‑based economy.  Banks invested customer deposits mainly in treasury bills and sukuk due to a lack of viable private‑sector opportunities .  When the war escalated in 2014–15, oil exports (the CBY’s main foreign‑currency source) halted and the CBY implemented capital controls, eroding trust in banks .  Wealthy Yemenis shifted funds to informal networks, leading to a severe liquidity crisis by mid‑2016 .  In September 2016 President Hadi relocated the CBY headquarters to Aden, creating two rival institutions: the Houthi‑aligned CBY‑Sana’a retained the infrastructure and staff, while the internationally recognised CBY‑Aden held international recognition .  Both branches suspended payments on public debt, turning bank‑held treasury bills into stranded assets .
	•	Islamization and debt conversion:  In August 2019 the CBY‑Sana’a froze interest accumulation on treasury bills and in September 2022 approved a draft law banning interest‑based transactions .  The proposal would convert more than YR1.7 trillion of treasury bills into non‑cash balances, a move toward Islamizing the financial system that risks intensifying banks’ liquidity crunch and undermines their solvency .

2. Divergent monetary policies and dual currencies
	•	CBY‑Aden monetary expansion vs. CBY‑Sana’a bans:  Beginning in 2017 the CBY‑Aden issued large volumes of new rials to cover public salaries and budget deficits .  This recurrent monetary expansion spurred exchange rate volatility and depreciation .  In response, Houthi authorities sought to weaponise monetary policy: between 2017 and 2019 they targeted traders using new banknotes  and, in January 2020, officially banned new rials in Houthi‑controlled areas .  This created two monetary zones: old rials in the north remained stable around YR560–YR604/US$1 , while new rials in government areas fluctuated wildly between YR800 and YR1,700/US$1 .
	•	Exchange rate arbitrage and speculation:  Money exchangers in Houthi areas exploited exchange‑rate differences to arbitrage profits .  The CBY‑Aden attempted to stabilise the market by launching weekly foreign‑currency auctions in November 2021, earmarking US dollars for qualified banks to finance basic imports .  However, inconsistent foreign‑currency supply and continued monetary expansion kept the rial volatile .

3. Politicization of letters of credit and SWIFT access
	•	Import financing leverage:  The CBY‑Aden’s control over the SWIFT network and the Saudi deposit allowed it to reopen letters of credit (LCs) for essential imports in 2018 .  It required banks to deposit collateral in physical rials to obtain foreign currency, which CBY‑Sana’a tried to circumvent by mandating non‑cash payments .  In November 2022 CBY‑Aden mandated that banks participating in foreign‑currency auctions share operations data to comply with AML/CFT requirements and to access US$300 million in IMF Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) .  The Fed insisted on semi‑annual assessments; banks needed CBY‑Aden certificates to maintain correspondent relationships  .
	•	Houthi response and geographical division:  Houthi authorities warned banks against sharing data and in mid‑January 2023 banned traders from conducting transactions with four local banks (three headquartered in Aden) and prohibited them from receiving FX from CBY‑Aden auctions .  This created a de facto geographical divide over the LC scheme, deepening the banking schism.  The Sana’a CBY issued circulars forbidding participation in CBY‑Aden auctions under the guise of preventing hard‑currency smuggling .

4. Rise of informal financial networks
	•	Expansion of hawala and money exchangers:  With banks constrained by the schism and liquidity shortages, traders increasingly turned to money exchangers and hawala networks, which have proliferated and now handle billions of dollars in domestic and international transfers .  These unregulated networks magnify currency instability through speculation  and pose high risks for money laundering and financing illicit activities .  The growth of informal finance reflects the erosion of trust in formal banks that began in 2016 and has accelerated since.

5. Renewed foreign‑currency support and prospects for mediation
	•	Fresh injections of funds:  In late 2022 and early 2023 Yemen received significant foreign‑currency support: US$300 million in IMF SDRs, US$1 billion from the Arab Monetary Fund (financed by Saudi Arabia) and nearly US$300 million from the UAE .  Saudi Arabia announced an additional US$1 billion deposit in February 2023 .  This assistance allowed CBY‑Aden to continue weekly currency auctions despite Houthi attacks halting oil exports .  However, by designating the Houthis as a terrorist group and planning to sanction banks tied to them, the government risks politicising the banking sector further【545337061728124†L320-L405】.
	•	Recommendations for focused interventions:  The brief argues that broad reconciliation is unrealistic; instead, stakeholders should pursue targeted measures to slow the entrenchment of parallel monetary systems and lay groundwork for technical coordination .  The main recommendations include:
	•	Prevent disqualification from CBY‑Aden auctions: Develop a compromise on data sharing to shield the banking sector from the wider conflict and strengthen AML/CFT compliance .
	•	Restart financial flows and address liquidity: Use a portion of foreign‑currency auction proceeds or SDR support to pay public sector salaries and release foreign‑exchange balances stranded at the CBY.  In return, CBY‑Sana’a should allow data sharing .
	•	Release BIS portfolio: If SDRs are not available, liquidate CBY’s estimated US$270 million portfolio at the BIS through a joint agreement .
	•	Ensure banks are not weaponized: The government should remove banks from its blacklist plans against the Houthis and the Houthis should stop coercive measures that isolate banks from global finance .

Analysis and takeaways
	1.	Deepening institutional schism:  This brief elucidates how the CBY split has permeated every aspect of Yemen’s financial system – from currency issuance and money‑supply management to import financing and anti‑money‑laundering compliance.  The creation of two currencies and conflicting regulations has entrenched economic fragmentation and fostered a lawless environment that benefits speculators and illicit networks.
	2.	Weaponization of regulatory tools:  Both CBY branches have used regulations as weapons.  The CBY‑Aden leverages control of SWIFT, auctions and foreign deposits to coerce compliance; CBY‑Sana’a uses its dominance in the banking geography to prohibit participation in Aden’s schemes.  The requirement for data sharing under AML/CFT compliance – an ostensibly technical measure – has become a battleground for sovereignty and surveillance.
	3.	Parallel to earlier warnings:  Earlier articles (2017–20) forecasted that the split would lead to divergent monetary policies and the spread of informal finance; this brief confirms those trends have materialised and deepened.  It connects the currency war (article 10) and data war (article 15) to a broader pattern of economic warfare, illustrating how each escalation builds on the last.
	4.	Policy realism:  Unlike earlier pieces that called for reunifying the central bank or sweeping reforms, this brief adopts a pragmatic approach.  It recognises that full reunification is unlikely in the current political climate and advocates for incremental steps: maintain auctions, pay salaries via banking channels, exchange data for liquidity, and ensure humanitarian funds are ring‑fenced.  This realism provides a pathway for stakeholders to stabilise the sector despite continuing conflict.

Policies & recommendations	Pragmatic suggestions: protect banks from exclusion, allocate auction funds to pay salaries, exchange data for liquidity, release BIS reserves, and keep banks off sanction lists .	These recommendations mark a shift from earlier broad calls to reunify the CBY (articles 7–8) toward incremental, technical steps. They also align with suggestions in article 12 to use SDRs prudently and article 10’s call for coordinated monetary policy.



Progress check on earlier recommendations

The brief shows that the major recommendations of earlier reports – reunifying the CBY, halting money printing, and restoring formal financial cycles – remain unfulfilled.  Instead, the schism has deepened with new regulations and the creation of two currencies.  There has been some progress: foreign‑currency auctions have mitigated volatility in government areas and new foreign support has arrived.  However, the data war (article 15) continues, and there is no unified monetary policy.  The targeted interventions proposed in this brief represent a shift from idealistic reforms to pragmatic crisis management.

Conclusion

The March 2023 policy brief “Bridging the Divide” provides the most comprehensive account to date of how Yemen’s banking schism has mutated into a fully fledged economic front in the war.  By documenting the emergence of dual currencies, the politicization of import financing and the explosive growth of informal finance, it highlights the urgency of shielding the banking sector from further weaponization.  Its recommendations emphasise focused, achievable steps – paying salaries through auctions, trading data for liquidity, and de‑politicising banks – as a way to slow Yemen’s economic fragmentation and maintain a foundation for future reconciliation.  Together with earlier reports, this analysis deepens our understanding of the complex interplay between monetary policy, financial regulation and humanitarian needs in the country’s ongoing conflict.

Practical notes & caveats you must keep in mind
	1.	Language & translations: most CBY circulars are published in Arabic. The CBY site has an English front page but many PDFs / circulars are Arabic only (you will need certified translations for legal use).  
	2.	Dual / fragmented supervision: Yemen has a dual central bank reality (Aden vs Sanaa). You explicitly asked for Aden — I filtered sources accordingly, but some third-party reports discuss both systems and may reference Sanaa-issued rules; always confirm the issuer before applying a regulation.  
	3.	Sanctions are dynamic: OFAC/EU/UK designations changed in 2024–2025 (including Houthi-linked designations and vessel designations). Any compliance system must pull live lists (OFAC, EU CONSLEG, UK) and have a sanctions-policy owner.  
	4.	IFRS-9 vs local provisioning rules: CBY’s historical provisioning circulars (and supervisory practices) include fixed provisioning rates (e.g. 15/45/100) that may differ from IFRS-9’s forward-looking ECL methodology. When building systems, map CBY supervisory categories into IFRS ECL buckets and track any supervisory overrides or add-ons.  
	5.	Microfinance particularities: the Microfinance Law grants MFBs some unique permissions (deposit taking, savings mobilization), but in practice capital, liquidity and reporting capacity vary widely — expect gaps and need for capacity building.

Yemen’s Central Bank (Aden): Economic Collapse and Policy Perspectives

## Monetary Fragmentation and Currency Crisis
 Yemen’s civil war split its banking system into two rival branches. In 2016 the internationally recognized government moved the Central Bank of Yemen to Aden and began issuing new rial banknotes to finance public spending . The Houthi authorities in Sana’a retained the old currency and by 2020 banned the post-2016 notes for large transactions . This schism effectively created two currencies in one country. The dual system has since produced dramatically divergent exchange rates: by mid-2025 the “new rial” in government-controlled areas was worth only about YR2,742 to the US$1 (a 78% drop since early 2024), whereas pre-2016 rials in Houthi areas held around YR535/USD . In fact, the Houthis even began minting their own 100-riyal coins in 2024 to entrench the split . A recent UN Panel of Experts warned that this parallel currency could allow the Houthi authorities to fund military spending while evading sanctions . In short, Yemen now functions as two monetary zones, undermining any unified monetary policy.

## Central Bank of Aden: Policies and Challenges
 By late 2021 the Aden-based central bank (CBY-Aden) had nearly exhausted a previous $2 billion Saudi deposit made in 2018, leaving only about $100 million for reserves . With foreign exchange reserves at critically low levels (less than one month of import cover ), CBY-Aden resorted to weekly currency auctions and other measures to manage liquidity. However, these auctions have largely failed to stabilize the rial – by mid-2025 most FX tenders attracted scant demand (as low as 22% uptake of a $30 million offer) . The bank’s foreign currency has been depleted by wage payments and import financing, and its power to intervene is very limited.

 The currency freefall has been driven in part by currency speculators and money-exchangers. In mid-2025 officials noted “rampant” market manipulation: unlicensed exchange shops were artificially hoarding dollars, devaluing the rial. In response CBY-Aden ordered all money-exchange outlets to halt foreign-currency transactions . At the same time, rumors that the bank might print new riyals to fund deficits circulated widely – a move it publicly denied . (Given the deep inflation, most analysts agree fresh printing would only worsen price rises.) These strains come amid Aden’s political instability and an uncompleted audit of the bank. Gulf partners repeatedly conditioned large aid injections on governance reforms, and delays in approving new oversight committees have left the bank effectively starved of fresh capital.

  International sanctions have further fractured Yemen’s finance. In 2024–25 the U.S. Treasury designated multiple Houthi-linked banks and firms (including the International Bank of Yemen, IBY), severing their SWIFT access . This action forced global remittance services like Western Union and MoneyGram to cut ties with IBY, disrupting dollar transfers to the north . To avoid falling under Houthi control, eight Yemeni banks announced in March 2025 they would relocate their headquarters to Aden . The coordination challenges and compliance requirements of these moves have further weakened CBY-Aden’s ability to manage the entire banking sector. In sum, the Aden central bank today faces near-empty FX reserves, a fractured banking network, and severe constraints from both war and sanctions.

## International Response and IMF Outlook
 In October 2025 the IMF resumed consultations with Yemen for the first time in a decade, underscoring the country’s dire situation. IMF staff report that Yemen’s economy has contracted by about 27% since 2014, leaving the country “among the world’s most fragile states” . Government revenues have collapsed (from 22.5% of GDP in 2014 to under 12% by 2024), while public debt has ballooned to over 100% of GDP . The IMF notes that currency depreciation and inflation have slashed real incomes, and that without urgent reforms and aid a full economic collapse is possible  .

The IMF and donors have supported Aden’s government with grants and loans, but with mixed results. A 2025 World Bank report projects Yemen’s GDP to shrink further (~–1.5% in 2025) due to continued conflict and reduced foreign support . Saudi Arabia and UAE have periodically deposited funds into the central bank: for example, in 2018 Riyadh placed $2 billion to stabilize the currency. But by late 2021 most of that grant was spent . In response to funding shortfalls, the Presidential Leadership Council agreed in 2022 to unlock another $3 billion (about $1 billion each from Saudi and UAE, plus additional fuel financing), but only after legal and auditing reforms . Internal political rifts have since stalled many of those reforms. Meanwhile, the IMF has urged Yemen’s authorities – both south and north – “to prioritize fiscal discipline, unify monetary policy, and restore central banking functions” under a single authority .

Against this backdrop, some positive policy steps have been taken in Aden. The IMF credits the government with a substantial fiscal adjustment: between 2022 and 2024 spending was cut by about 5.4 percentage points of GDP, largely offsetting lost oil revenue . With help from roughly $2 billion in Saudi grants (2023–24), the budget deficit was squeezed to under 2% of GDP by 2024 . The central bank financed ongoing deficits through treasury overdrafts, which it “sterilized” by selling foreign assets to mop up excess liquidity . In mid-2025, Aden’s government also created a National Committee for the Regulation and Financing of Imports (NCRFI) and imposed stricter FX controls (raising customs exchange rates, curtailing forex trading, etc.). These measures have had some effect: by late 2025 the rial began to appreciate and inflation showed signs of easing .

In public statements, IMF and donor officials have stressed that sustained support hinges on credible reforms. They note that Yemen needs not only cash aid but also institutions: unified monetary policy, transparent budgeting, and integrated banking are prerequisites for recovery  . For instance, IMF staff emphasize the importance of donor-funded emergency transfers to civilian payrolls and food imports to prevent humanitarian collapse – but only alongside measures that ensure funds do not fuel corruption  .

## Economic and Humanitarian Impact
 The financial crisis is already a human crisis. The IMF stresses that Yemen’s humanitarian emergency is among the worst globally, with over half the population (20+ million people) needing urgent aid . Conflict, aid shortfalls, and the rial collapse have driven food insecurity to record levels. The UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization projects that about 17.1 million Yemenis will face high levels of acute hunger in 2025. Prices have soared: in government-controlled areas the cost of a basic food basket in May 2025 was roughly 37% higher than a year earlier (and nearly 50% above the three-year average) .

Hyperinflation and unemployment have rocked livelihoods. Official data suggest inflation in 2024 hit about 27%, rising above 35% by mid-2025 as the currency lost more value . Remittances have been disrupted by banking sanctions, reducing household income in the south. Meanwhile, public wages are often delayed or unpaid: by late 2025 most government salaries in Aden had not been paid for months. The resulting economic hardship has fueled public anger and protests. Observers warn that continued financial collapse could precipitate famine and social breakdown. One analyst bluntly states that if the rial “continues to fall, a broader economic collapse is highly likely,” which would in turn deepen political fragmentation and jeopardize even the fragile truce .

In sum, Yemen’s economy is in tailspin: exports have evaporated, imports (90% of needs) are squeezed, and basic services (electricity, fuel, health) are failing. The UN and aid agencies repeatedly caution that without large injections of foreign currency and fuel the country risks a catastrophic humanitarian spiral  .

## Strategic Outlook and Recommendations
Analysts and aid experts agree that stopping the collapse will require both financial rescue and structural reforms. Key recommendations include:
	•	Provide targeted currency support. Donors (Saudi Arabia, UAE, international community) should channel substantial hard currency into CBY-Aden to stabilize the rial and fund essential imports (food, fuel, medicines) .  Such funding must be accompanied by safeguards to ensure it is used for public goods, not corruption.
	•	Mitigate sanctions’ humanitarian impact. International sanctions should exempt basic economic transactions.  For example, the U.S. has pressured the Houthi-aligned IBY bank, disrupting remittances and aid transfers .  Policymakers should allow humanitarian organizations and ordinary Yemenis to use money transfer networks despite the conflict  .  (One proposal is to create special “humanitarian exceptions” so food, medical, and civilian payroll funding can flow even if broader sanctions remain in place.)
	•	Unify financial systems.  Any settlement must eventually reunite Yemen’s banking and currency.  Analysts stress restoring one central bank and one currency is essential for recovery  .  In practice this means fostering dialogue between CBY-Aden and CBY-Sana’a to integrate their networks.  Pending unity, authorities should minimize fragmentation: for instance, Aden’s recent Unified Money Transfer Network was a step to consolidate transactions (though initially resisted by Sana’a ).  The international community should support such integration efforts and press both sides to agree on a common rial, even if implemented gradually.
	•	Revive oil/gas exports.  Yemen’s few remaining revenue streams lie in hydrocarbons.  Negotiating a ceasefire provision that allows safe export of Marib fields or funding of Hadramawt oil (for power generation) could yield billions in needed foreign exchange .  Observers note the government lost over $7.5 billion in oil/gas revenues since 2022 due to Houthi blockades .  International mediators should prioritize reopening this channel, tying it to confidence-building measures.
	•	Push governance reforms.  Donors should condition large aid packages on transparency and anti-corruption measures. The Gulf pledges ($3 billion) were explicitly contingent on creating oversight committees for budget and tenders .  The Yemeni leadership (Presidential Leadership Council and Finance Ministry) must approve and implement these reforms promptly.  Without basic fiscal governance and clear audits, additional money risks being wasted or diverted, which in turn undermines donor willingness to invest further.

These steps must be pursued in parallel with intensified humanitarian relief. Analysts warn that if the currency collapse continues, it will override any political plans – including peace talks – because millions of Yemenis simply cannot survive an economic implosion  . In the words of one policy brief: immediate financial support “could prevent systemic collapse” and avoid further suffering . The coming months will be critical: stabilizing the rial and halting inflation can buy time for political solutions, whereas continued inaction risks irreversible damage to Yemen’s society and future.

Climate and water risk — bringing a genuinely new supervisory lens

What the evidence says
	•	The World Bank’s Yemen Country Climate and Development Report (2024) warns that under pessimistic climate scenarios, Yemen’s annual GDP could fall ~3.9% by 2040, largely due to water scarcity and infrastructure damage; even in optimistic cases, climate will drive volatility.  
	•	Yemen is already at the edge of water and food insecurity; climate is not a future problem, it’s an amplifier of today’s shocks (crop failure, displacement, local conflict over water).  
	•	Globally, the Financial Stability Board and central bank networks now frame climate shocks as financial stability risks, not environmental side notes: sudden droughts/floods trigger credit losses, repricing and bank retrenchment.  

How most people treat this in Yemen

Climate and water usually sit in separate reports: “climate adaptation”, “water security”, “food security”. They rarely show up inside a banking supervisor’s ECL scenario engine.

What you bring that’s different

You can push a climate-conflict scenario engine as a native part of IFRS-9 for Yemen:
	•	Add a set of macro “shock variables” into the scenario layer:
	•	Conflict intensity index;
	•	Local water stress indicators;
	•	Crop yield proxies;
	•	Displacement waves.
	•	For portfolios exposed to agriculture, rural MSMEs or water-dependent activities, scenario weights should explicitly include climate/water shocks, not generic global GDP shocks.

That does two things:
	1.	It tells IMF and donors: “We are not copy-pasting standard IFRS-9 — we are building a Yemen-specific macro-prudential lens that integrates climate, water and conflict into forward-looking losses.”
	2.	It opens doors to climate finance and debt tools:
	•	Yemen is on the list of fragile states pushing for climate-security funding at global fora.  
	•	Countries like Barbados are using innovative debt-for-climate swaps to free fiscal space for adaptation.  

Digital rails, e-commerce and fintech — not a luxury, but the future supervisory perimeter

Reality on the ground
	•	A 2025 paper on digital transformation in Yemeni banking describes a sector attempting to digitise under extreme constraints: dual central banks, weak infrastructure, low literacy, sanctions and security risks. Yet it notes unmistakable momentum: banks, mobile networks, and even small fintechs are experimenting with digital payments and online banking.  
	•	A recent Sana’a Center/DeepRoot/CARPO policy brief on e-commerce in Yemen shows significant potential for online trade to drive growth and inclusion, especially for women and rural entrepreneurs, but points to barriers: payments infrastructure, KYC/AML, and trust.  

Why this matters for your IFRS-9/AML system

If CBY-Aden does not extend its data and AML perimeter to cover:
	•	mobile wallets,
	•	online merchant acquiring,
	•	marketplace platform flows,
	•	and fintech-style micro-credit,

then a parallel, largely unregulated financial layer will grow under its feet. That would:
	•	Undermine AML/CFT efforts;
	•	Deprive you of valuable behavioural data for credit models;
	•	Make it harder to ever “retrofit” supervision.

FATF, reputation and Yemen’s “second chance” on AML/CFT

Current and historic FATF reality
	•	Yemen made a high-level political commitment to work with FATF/MENAFATF and in 2014 FATF acknowledged it had “substantially addressed” its action plan at a technical level: criminalising ML/TF, freezing terrorist assets, improving CDD/STR, issuing guidance, building supervisory and FIU capacity.  
	•	But since the war, that progress has stalled or reversed in practice: supervision is fragmented; the FIU’s effective reach is limited; cash and exchangers are dominant. Donors and correspondents treat Yemen as high risk — even if the formal FATF text is old.

central banks and currencies;
	•	Sanctioned banks and relocating headquarters;
	•	Remittances and humanitarian cash as the real flows;
	•	Climate and water stress accelerating default risks;
	•	A digital transition happening in an unregulated way.

Yemen effectively has two monetary zones and two central banks, with competing currencies and rules.
	•	Banks are moving: sanctions and commercial logic are slowly pulling serious institutions toward Aden, but their systems and data are still fragmented.
	•	The formal banking sector is small and weak compared to exchangers, hawala networks and mobile money.
	•	IMF, METAC and the World Bank are back in the room with Yemen; they have diagnostics and training ready, but limited patience.
	•	Sanctions, remittances and humanitarian cash are now as important to the financial map as classic credi


CBY–Aden does not yet see a unified risk picture.
Banks are split, some head offices are still formally in Sana’a, and exchangers dominate flows. Supervision is as fragmented as the country.
	2.	The usable data is thin, messy and uneven.
Loan books are small, records are inconsistent, and a lot of real activity is in cash, hawala and mobile channels.
	3.	Sanctions and reputation now decide who stays “inside” the global system.
Recent designations made clear: a bank can be large domestically and still be cut off overnight if the sanctions / AML story is weak.

Chatham House (2011) — “Yemen’s Economy: Oil, Imports and Elites.”
The paper states that “less than ten major groups from the tribes, military, and business elite control more than 80 per cent of the country’s import, manufacturing and processing businesses, local commercial banks, telecommunications firms and transport companies.” This is the earliest widely-cited formulation.  
	•	Chatham House (2013) — “Corruption, Capital Flight and Global Drivers of Conflict.”
Repeats the finding (citing the 2011 work): “less than ten family concerns control 80 per cent of Yemen’s imports and manufacturing.”  
	•	World Bank Country Economic Memorandum (2020/2022 updates).
Uses the same statistic in its narrative on market concentration (attributing it to Hill/Chatham House 2013).  

large conglomerates or elite-linked entities that dominated key import-heavy sectors pre-2015 and/or in the war economy. Examples:
	•	HSA Group (Hayel Saeed Anam) — the country’s largest conglomerate; dominated staples (e.g., wheat flour) and FMCG manufacturing/imports. Sana’a Center analysis documents HSA’s outsized market share in flour and explains how such concentration drives pricing power.  
	•	YECO (military-run conglomerate) — cited in the 2011 Chatham House study as part of how the security establishment used a state-linked company to manage food prices, illustrating the military–business nexus.  
	•	Sabafon (telecom) — long associated with Hamid al-Ahmar; a flagship private telecom operator that exemplified elite control of strategic sectors.
	•	Fuel importing networks — during the conflict, influence shifted in fuels; for instance Ahmed al-Essi and affiliated firms are documented as dominant in Aden-area fuel imports—an example of how war-time rents reinforced elite control of import channels.

Bottom line
	•	The “10 families / 80%” statistic comes from Chatham House (2011) and is echoed by Chatham House (2013) and later World Bank work. None of these provide a public, named list.  
	•	Credible analyses consistently point to a small circle of family conglomerates and security-linked entities dominating imports, manufacturing, banking, telecoms and logistics; specific examples above illustrate the pattern, but no official published roster of the “ten” exists in the cited sources. If you want, I can compile documented profiles by sector (ownership, market share, political ties, sanctions exposure) strictly from primary/credible reporting.

	•	The Humanitarian Central Bank: How Cash Transfers Crowned Hawala as Yemen’s Settlement Layer
	•	From Stopgap to System: The Decade Aid Entrenched Exchangers over Banks in Yemen

Humanitarian cash and emergency programs—designed to bypass a fractured banking system—ended up becoming Yemen’s de facto monetary infrastructure, institutionalizing money exchangers (hawala) as the country’s dominant settlement layer and reshaping financial power from 2015 to 2025.

What’s uniquely new here
	1.	Follow the money as “infrastructure” (not as “benefits”): trace who handled the flows, how rules adapted, which institutions gained/waned—year by year.
	2.	Event-study design: stitch the CBY split, aid program rollouts, licensing waves, and fee-income collapses into one causal timeline.
	3.	Original indices to quantify what everyone has only implied:
	•	Hawala Dependence Index (HDI-Yemen): % of total aid & domestic retail flows processed outside regulated banks (constructed from aid payment agent rosters + bank statements + exchanger volume proxies).
	•	Bank Disintermediation Score (BDS): normalized drop in bank fee income + rise in off-balance-sheet transfers + share of liquidity held outside banks (use state bank FS as signal).
	•	Licensing Shock Meter (LSM): count and timing of microfinance-bank licenses issued to exchanger groups across both CBYs.

Spine of the story (2015→2025)
	•	2015–2016: System fracture. CBY split; banks become risk-averse, concentrated, and disconnected across frontlines; reliance on cash and hawala accelerates. The sector was underdeveloped even pre-war; formal banks prioritized T-bills over intermediation.    
	•	2017–2019: Humanitarian monetization. Aid and social cash lean on exchangers; MFIs/MFBs retrench; unregulated lenders expand; a World-Bank/UNDP facility (YECRP) even pays off MFI portfolios to stabilize the sector—evidence of formal credit collapse and a pivot to informal liquidity.    
	•	2020: Banks’ fee engines stall. State bank statements show sharp year-over-year falls in fee income—classic disintermediation signal as payment flows migrate off-bank.  
	•	2021–2025: Formalizing the informal. A surge of new microfinance-bank licenses—often transformed exchanger houses—moves the shadow system into lightly-regulated “quasi-banks”, with warnings of a license bubble and stability risk.  
	•	Parallel digital rails. With two CBYs and sanctions risk, policy diverges; non-bank e-money and exchanger-run rails proliferate; most Yemenis use hawala; Sanaa CBY dominates domestically while Aden CBY anchors SWIFT access.      

Evidence plan (do-able, compelling)
	•	Bank statements signal: Use National Bank of Yemen’s audited notes to show fee-income and commissions collapse (2019→2020), liquidity posture, and inability to verify branch data post-split—symptoms of a broken banking channel.      
	•	Market structure shift: RYE/Sana’a Center analyses documenting the rise of exchangers and the licensing wave of MFBs since 2021; explicit warnings that rapid licenses without planning could threaten stability.

But code the exchangers names or seethe best practices and what is right fit

An ensure to ensure the humanitarian aid and relation to finance and economics contesting and complete

From 2015 to 2025, Yemen’s financial plumbing was rebuilt in the open, but almost no one named it. The Central Bank split, banks froze, and humanitarian actors had to move money at scale. The only nationwide rails that still worked were money exchangers (hawala) and, later, microfinance banks spun out of exchanger groups. Delivering cash assistance through those rails was the right call to reach people fast. But a decade later, that stop-gap has become the system: liquidity, payments, and retail finance are dominated by non-bank intermediaries; formal banks matter for SWIFT, compliance and balance sheets, but not for everyday settlement. The article traces the arc, weighs human impacts (positive and negative), and tests counterfactuals—what if the Emergency Cash Transfer (ECT) had been paused, or never launched.

⸻

1) What actually changed, year by year

2015–2016 | System fracture.
	•	Conflict collapses confidence; the Central Bank splits; bank branch networks become segmented by frontlines; interbank settlement frays.
	•	Retail transactions shift further to cash and hawala—already strong pre-war—because exchangers can bridge lines of control.

2017–2019 | Humanitarian monetization.
	•	Cash-based aid scales up. Agencies route payments via exchanger networks and selected MFIs/MFBs to reach beneficiaries at speed.
	•	Result: exchangers gain operational capacity, public legitimacy, and fee income at national scale.

2020–2022 | Disintermediation visible.
	•	State/commercial banks show classic stress signals: lower fee/commission income from payments; higher reliance on balance-sheet activities; difficulty moving cash between territories.
	•	Humanitarian programs, remittances, retail transfers increasingly clear on non-bank rails.

2023–2025 | Formalizing the informal.
	•	Big exchanger houses convert into microfinance banks; licensing proliferates under fragmented regulatory regimes.
	•	E-money and agent models expand—but mostly outside classical bank switching/clearing.
	•	Net effect: a “shadow ledger”—functionally a national settlement layer—sits outside full central-bank traction.

⸻

2) Human impact: the ledger of benefits vs. externalities

Positive impacts (why it worked)
	•	Reach at scale. Exchangers’ footprint, hours, and risk appetite beat banks in conflict settings. That meant higher inclusion where banks couldn’t operate.
	•	Speed and continuity. Cash arrived even when frontlines shifted. This stabilized household consumption (food, rent, medicines) and smoothed shocks (displacement, wage arrears).
	•	Local economic multipliers. Liquidity injections through markets—not in-kind—kept shops alive, preserved supply chains, and reduced aid leakage via logistics.
	•	Dignity & choice. Beneficiaries chose priorities (e.g., school fees vs. food vs. debt service), which improves welfare matches relative to rations.

Negative/structural externalities (the bill that arrived later)
	•	Bank disintermediation. Payments, remittances and retail liquidity sat off-bank. Fee engines for banks collapsed, weakening an already thin sector.
	•	Regulatory perimeter loss. A parallel settlement layer consolidated outside unified oversight—harder AML/CFT traction, harder monetary policy transmission, and pricing power accrued to a few large exchangers.
	•	License bubble risk. Rapid conversion of exchanger houses into microfinance banks without robust prudential supervision risks over-lending, client over-indebtedness, and mission drift (urban bias).
	•	Territorial inequity. Exchanger density is urban; rural last-mile agents exist but weaker. Women and persons with limited mobility may still face access, harassment, or fee burdens.
	•	Aid path dependency. Once major programs integrate with exchanger platforms (data flows, reconciliations, SOPs), switching back to banks is non-trivial—locking in the shadow ledger.
	•	State capacity erosion. When most domestic payments avoid bank rails, central authorities struggle to enforce KYC tiers, netting, settlement discipline, or consumer protection.

⸻

3) Did the ECT “cause” this? A fair causal reading

Short answer: No—ECT didn’t create hawala dominance; it institutionalized it.
	•	Pre-conditions already existed: a risk-averse banking sector, concentration in treasury assets, weak intermediation, and strong informal networks.
	•	Counterfactual market forces—remittances, trader finance, public-salary arrears—were flowing on hawala rails regardless.
	•	ECT’s distinctive effect was scale and legitimacy: routing a nationwide social-protection flow through exchangers accelerated capacity-building (IT, reconciliations, liquidity management, grievance redress), then normalized those rails for everything else.

Think in margins: hawala would still rule retail flows; ECT made it faster and stickier.

⸻

4) Counterfactuals (to keep the analysis honest)

A) If ECT had been paused/frozen mid-stream
	•	Short-term: sharp consumption shock (food, rent, medicine), negative coping (distress sales, child labor risk), and price spikes as shops lose cash buyers.
	•	Medium-term: no structural re-banking; retail flows still on exchangers (remittances, wages, trader credit). Aid-driven path dependency slows, but shadow rails remain.

B) If no ECT at all (but other aid continues)
	•	Human cost: worse poverty, malnutrition, and displacement outcomes; higher aid delivery costs via in-kind or ad-hoc modalities.
	•	Financial structure: hawala still dominant; banks don’t recover without macro fixes; exchanger consolidation happens anyway, just slower and less professionalized.

Conclusion: ECT saved lives and reduced harm; it also hardened a pre-existing structural shift. The right lesson is not “don’t do cash”—it’s how to couple cash with a re-banking strategy.

⸻

5) Simplifying the story for non-experts

One sentence: Aid had to choose a road to carry money; the banks’ road was broken, so it used the exchangers’ road. Ten years later, the exchangers’ road became the highway.

One picture in words:
2015: Two roads → bank road blocked; small side road (hawala) open.
2017–2020: Ambulances (aid cash) use the side road; it gets paved and widened.
2025: Most traffic uses that road; the old highway is still there, but fewer cars and toll booths (fees) are drying up.

⸻

6) Evidence architecture you can put in an annex (very doable)

Figure 1 — Timeline (2015–2025):
CBY split → first large cash windows → remittance surges → branch closures/fragmentation → exchanger-to-MFB licensing spikes → e-money pilots.

Figure 2 — “Follow the Money” Sankey:
Donor → UN agency → Payment agents (banks vs exchangers) → Beneficiaries; annotate the share routed via non-bank rails by year (even as ranges).

Figure 3 — Three indices to quantify what’s long been implied:
	•	Hawala Dependence Index (HDI-Yemen): % of retail/aid flows cleared outside banks (built from payment-agent rosters, tender awards, and reconciliations).
	•	Bank Disintermediation Score (BDS): normalized change in bank fee/commission income vs. asset growth; branch operability notes; reliance on cash holdings.
	•	Licensing Shock Meter (LSM): count & timing of microfinance-bank licenses; flag lineage from exchanger houses.

Figure 4 — “Crossing lines”:
Dual axes showing (a) bank fee income trend (proxy for payments business health), and (b) cumulative exchanger/MFB licenses over time.

You don’t need privileged data to publish the structure of these figures; you can render the shapes with ranges and label clearly where precise numbers are pending. The argument still lands.

⸻

7) Policy options (pragmatic, not idealistic)

A. Keep cash—change the rails mix
	•	Agent banking via exchangers: certify larger exchangers as banking agents under tiered KYC; push settlements through bank master accounts daily/weekly.
	•	Risk-sharing windows: donors co-fund guarantees that let banks re-enter last-mile payments without balance-sheet pain.
	•	National switch “lite”: a neutral, low-cost clearing utility for domestic retail payments (banks + MFBs + PSPs), even while CBYs remain fragmented.

B. Discipline the license boom
	•	Temporary pause on new MFB licenses; minimum prudential and client-protection thresholds; credit registry and shared over-indebtedness checks.
	•	Urban-rural obligations for MFBs (like telecom USO): % of agents/loans outside top cities.

C. Data, transparency, trust
	•	Publish payment-agent rosters, fee schedules, and grievance redress stats for cash programs.
	•	Gender-safe access: discrete queues, choice of payout points, and female agent quotas where culturally appropriate.
	•	Consumer-protection hotline across rails; fee cap guidance in emergencies.

⸻

8) What you can claim, confidently and objectively
	•	Cash via exchangers was necessary and effective for human outcomes.
	•	It also accelerated a lasting power shift from banks to non-bank intermediaries.
	•	Without deliberate re-banking design (agent models, clearing, supervision), stabilization and AML/CFT traction will stay weak—even if peace arrives.
	•	The right choice now is both/and: keep the inclusive rails and rebuild banking’s role in settlement, clearing, and consumer protection.

Follow the money as infrastructure. Not “who benefited,” but “which rails carried value, how rules adapted, and who gained or lost power—year by year.”
	•	Event-study design. A single causal timeline that stitches together the CBY split, aid program rollouts, exchanger→MFB licensing waves, and bank fee-income collapse.
	•	Three original indices that quantify what everyone has only implied:
	•	HDI-Yemen (Hawala Dependence Index): share of aid + retail flows processed outside regulated banks.
	•	BDS (Bank Disintermediation Score): normalized decline in bank fee/commission income + rise in off-balance-sheet transfers + liquidity held off-bank.
	•	LSM (Licensing Shock Meter): number and timing of microfinance-bank (MFB) licenses issued to exchanger groups under both CBYs.

The spine (2015 → 2025)

2015–2016 | System fracture.
The Central Bank splits; interbank settlement frays; branch networks are cut by frontlines. Formal banks—already conservative—retreat further. Retail payments tilt to cash and hawala because exchangers can bridge lines of control.

2017–2019 | Humanitarian monetization.
Cash-based aid scales fast. To reach people, agencies rely on exchanger networks and a handful of MFIs/MFBs. The unintended effect: exchangers gain national legitimacy, reconciliation workflows, real-time liquidity management—and recurring fee income.

2020 | Banks’ fee engines stall.
State/commercial banks show classic disintermediation signals: fee and commission income slips; payment volumes migrate off-bank; moving cash between territories gets harder. The everyday money highway is now informal.

2021–2025 | Formalizing the informal.
Large exchanger houses convert into MFBs; licensing proliferates under fragmented regulation. E-money and agent models expand—but mostly off classical bank switches. The net result: a “shadow ledger”—a functional national settlement layer—sits beyond full central-bank traction.

Parallel digital rails.
Two CBYs, divergent policies, sanctions risk. Non-bank e-money and exchanger-run rails proliferate. Aden anchors SWIFT access; Sana’a dominates domestic clearing. Most households use hawala.

Human impact: the ledger of benefits vs. externalities

What worked (and saved lives)
	•	Reach at scale. Exchangers had the widest footprint, longest hours, and highest risk tolerance. Inclusion rose where banks couldn’t operate.
	•	Speed and continuity. Cash arrived through frontline shifts, stabilizing consumption (food, rent, medicine) and smoothing shocks (displacement, wage arrears).
	•	Market multipliers. Liquidity through shops kept micro-supply chains alive, with lower logistics leakage than in-kind aid.
	•	Dignity of choice. Households allocated cash to their most urgent needs, improving the welfare match.

The bill that arrived later
	•	Bank disintermediation. Payments, remittances, and retail liquidity now sit off-bank. Fee engines withered; a thin sector got thinner.
	•	Regulatory perimeter loss. A parallel settlement layer consolidated outside unified oversight—harder AML/CFT traction, weaker monetary policy transmission, and pricing power accruing to a few large exchangers.
	•	License-bubble risk. Exchanger→MFB conversions outpaced supervision. Risks: over-lending, client over-indebtedness, and mission drift toward urban, low-risk borrowers.
	•	Territorial inequity. Exchanger density is urban; rural last mile is spottier. Women and those with limited mobility still face access frictions and fee burdens.
	•	Aid path-dependency. Once major programs plug into exchanger platforms (data, reconciliation, SOPs), pivoting back to banks is costly—locking in the shadow rails.
	•	State capacity erosion. When most domestic payments bypass banks, it’s harder to enforce KYC tiers, netting discipline, or consumer protection.

⸻

Causality, fairly stated

Did ECT “cause” hawala dominance? No. It accelerated and institutionalized a pre-existing shift.
	•	Pre-conditions: an under-intermediated banking sector and strong informal networks existed pre-war.
	•	Counterfactual currents: remittances, trader finance, and public salary arrears were already flowing via hawala.
	•	ECT’s distinct effect: scale + legitimacy. Routing a nationwide social-protection flow through exchangers hardened their capacity (IT, cash management, complaint handling) and normalized those rails for everything else.

Bottom line: hawala would still rule retail; ECT made it faster and stickier—while preventing much deeper human harm.

⸻

Counterfactuals (for intellectual honesty)

A) Freeze ECT mid-stream
	•	Short-term: consumption shock, negative coping (distress sales, child labor risk), localized price spikes.
	•	Medium-term: no automatic “re-banking.” Remittances and trade still move on exchangers. The shadow rails remain; they just grow slower.

B) No ECT at all
	•	Human cost: higher poverty, malnutrition, and displacement; higher delivery costs via in-kind modalities.
	•	Financial structure: hawala still dominates; banks do not recover without macro fixes; exchanger consolidation happens anyway—less professionalized, more opaque.

⸻

Make it simple for non-experts

One line: The bank road was broken, so aid used the side road. Ten years later, the side road became the highway.

One visual in words:
2015: Two roads—bank road blocked; small hawala track open.
2017–2020: Ambulances (aid cash) use the track; it’s paved and widened.
2025: Most traffic takes that road; the old highway exists, but its toll booths (bank fees) are empty.

⸻

Method (what we actually compute)
	1.	Event-Study Timeline (2014–2025)
Milestones: CBY split; big cash windows; AML/sanctions steps; exchanger→MFB licensing spikes; dual-rate FX policy shifts.
	2.	Institutional Flow Mapping (Sankey)
Donor → UN agency → payment agents (banks vs exchangers) → beneficiaries; annotate why/when banks were bypassed.
	3.	Indices (HDI, BDS, LSM)
	•	HDI: share of payments executed via non-bank agents (UNICEF/UNDP agent rosters, tender awards, ops reports).
	•	BDS: fee income / assets trend vs proxies for off-bank transfers (exchanger licensing counts, e-money users). Anchor on a state bank series.
	•	LSM: MFB licenses over time; tag those converted from exchanger houses.
	4.	Counterfactual check
Compare governorates with stronger bank presence to hawala-heavy areas: did the aid rail correlate with later exchanger dominance?

بوصلة الاقتصاد والمال في اليمن

منصة استخبارات اقتصادية للحرب والسلام

ما هي؟
منصّة تفاعلية ثنائية اللغة تجمع في مكانٍ واحد الصورة الكاملة للاقتصاد اليمني زمن الحرب—الأسعار، العملة، النفط، الناتج، قرارات البنـكين المركزيين، التمويل الأصغر، البنوك التجارية، تقارير المانحين، والأطراف المؤثّرة—وتحوّلها إلى مؤشّرات قابلة للاستكشاف، أدوات حساب، وسيناريوهات “ماذا لو؟”.

الفكرة ببساطة: اختر سنة، غيّر الفرضيات، وشاهد: ماذا حدث؟ ماذا كان سيحدث لو تغيّر عاملٌ ما؟ وماذا قد يحدث لاحقًا؟

قيم المنصّة: الشفافية • المساءلة • التمكين.

⸻

لماذا هذه المنصّة مختلفة؟
	•	ازدواج نقدي مُدار: تتبّعٌ منفصل ودقيق لقرارات وسلوك البنك المركزي – عدن والبنك المركزي – صنعاء وتأثيرهما على السوق.
	•	دوالّ زمنية حقيقية: كل لوحة بيانات مرتبطة بخط زمني للأحداث والصدمات، لا أرقام معزولة.
	•	أدوات عملية: حاسبات تضخّم/سعر صرف، ومحرّك سيناريوهات يتيح بناء توقعات مؤسّسة على فرضيات قابلة للضبط.
	•	قابلية التدقيق: كل رقم يعود إلى بطاقة مصدر، ويمكن تصدير البيانات CSV للاستخدام المؤسسي.
	•	ثنائية اللغة (ع/En) مع قابلية للتوسّع لاحقًا للغات الأمم المتحدة.

ماذا تضم كل وحدة؟ (مختصر واضح + ما يميّزه)

1) لوحة البيانات الاقتصادية التفاعلية (2014–2025)
	•	النفط والإيرادات: إنتاج سنوي، إيرادات تقديرية، وخسائر تراكمية بسبب الانقطاعات (تظهر بطاقة تقديرية للخسائر التراكمية ~$35B).
	•	الناتج المحلي (GDP): مسار الناتج من $43.2B (2014) إلى قراءات أحدث (بطاقات مقارنة سنوية + توزيع قطاعي).
	•	التضخم: اتجاهات التضخم العام وتضخم الغذاء لكل منطقة، مع تضخّم تراكمي يوضح فقدان القوة الشرائية.
	•	مزايا: فلاتر سنة/موضوع، بطاقات مقارنة بسنة الأساس 2014، تصدير CSV.

2) تطوّر أسعار الصرف (حرب العملة)
	•	مساران منفصلان: عدن وصنعاء.
	•	بطاقات سنة 2025 (كمثال من الصور): عدن ~1700 YER/USD، صنعاء ~630 YER/USD، فجوة ~1070.
	•	خط زمني تفسيري: نقل البنك، الودائع، القيود المصرفية، العقوبات، الحصار…
	•	صندوق “الرأي الرئيسي” يشرح باختصار معنى الفجوة النقدية ومخاطرها.

3) الحاسبات المالية التفاعلية
	•	حاسبة سعر الصرف: تحويل USD ⇄ YER لعدن/صنعاء بحسب أي سنة مختارة، مع إظهار الفجوة.
	•	حاسبة التضخّم: حساب القيمة الحقيقية لمبلغ عبر الزمن (مثال ظاهر: 1000 ريال 2015 ≈ 8431 ريال 2025 ⇒ فقدان ~88% من القوة الشرائية).

4) “الأحداث والتحديات”
	•	19 حدثًا اقتصاديًا/ماليًا رئيسيًا مرتبطًا بـ 12 تحديًا بنيويًا و5 مسارات تطور.

طبقة الذكاء الاصطناعي وميزة “السفر عبر الزمن”

ماذا تفعل فعليًا؟
	1.	اختيار أي سنة (خلفيًا 2014–2025 واللاحق): تغيّر كل اللوحات تلقائيًا إلى وضع تلك السنة (السعر، التضخم، الناتج، قرارات البنكين، الأحداث).
	2.	“ماذا لو؟” (What-If): منزلقات لضبط الفرضيات (سعر النفط، تدفقات المساعدات، مستوى التوتر، قيود مصرفية/صرافة)، ثمّ إعادة حساب فورية لآثارها على الناتج/التضخم/الفجوة.
	3.	تغذية حية بالمؤشّرات: عند وصل واجهات بيانات (نفط، أسعار فائدة، تقارير جديدة، تحديثات مساعدات)، تتجدّد الملخصات والإنذارات والسيناريوهات تلقائيًا.
	4.	تقارير مخصّصة بضغطة: توليد مذكرات سياسات وملفات موجزة للمانحين حسب سيناريو معيّن (مثل: أثر فجوة الصرف على برامج النقد/الدعم السلعي).

تنبيه مهني: التوقعات استرشادية وليست بديلًا عن التقديرات الرسمية—تظهر ملاحظة ذلك بوضوح في الصفحات.

	•	صنّاع السياسة: تتبّع أثر أي قرار نقدي جديد على فجوة السعر والقطاع المصرفي.
	•	الباحثون/الصحافة: استخراج سريع لرسوم موثّقة وقابلة للتحميل، مع سرد زمني للأحداث.
	•	المواطنون/القطاع الخاص: فهم بسيط للفروقات بين أسواق العملة وأسعار السلع عبر الزمن والمناطق.
