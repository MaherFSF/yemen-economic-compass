### FROM: Yemen PDF Report (Extracted)

**Key Findings:**
- Real GDP per capita plummeted 58% since 2015
- Inflation exceeding 30% in government areas (2024)
- Yemeni rial depreciated 30% in 2025 alone
- Monthly inflation 35% by July 2025
- 2016 Central Bank split institutionalized dual currency systems
- Humanitarian response severely underfunded (19% of $2.5B secured)
- $2.8B annual cash flows through non-bank channels by 2025
- Real income per capita at 45% of 2015 baseline
- Poverty rate 76% in 2025 (from 54% in 2014)
- Exchange rate: 215 YER/USD (2014) → 2,800 (2025)
- 17.1M people facing acute food insecurity by Feb 2025

**Transformation Narrative:**
"From 2015 to 2025, Yemen's financial infrastructure underwent a profound transformation that occurred largely unnoticed by the international community. When the Central Bank split and formal banking channels froze, humanitarian actors faced an unprecedented challenge: how to move money at scale in a fragmented conflict zone. The solution—routing emergency cash transfers through money exchangers (hawala) and microfinance institutions—was both pragmatic and consequential. While this approach successfully delivered life-saving assistance to millions, it simultaneously catalyzed a fundamental restructuring of Yemen's financial architecture."

**Current State:**
"Today, liquidity, payments, and retail finance are dominated by non-bank intermediaries. Formal banks remain relevant for SWIFT transactions and compliance, but have largely been displaced from everyday settlement activities."
