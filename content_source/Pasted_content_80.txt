Yemen’s Financial and Economic Trajectory (2015–2025)

Figure: Infographic depiction of Yemen’s conflict zones and actors (Houthis vs. government/coalition) and its economic impact (source: Al Jazeera) – the duality of control laid the groundwork for today’s split financial system.

Between 2015 and 2025 Yemen’s economy has been upended by civil war, institutional fragmentation, and external pressures.  The collapse of unified state authority left two parallel financial systems: the Houthi‑led authorities (in Sana’a and the north) and the internationally‑recognized government (IRG, now led by the Riyadh‑backed Presidential Leadership Council) in the south.  Each side established its own central bank, currency and fiscal strategy.  What began as a conventional conflict quickly morphed into an economic war: oil exports were seized or blockaded, customs and taxes were contested, and each camp weaponized monetary and fiscal policy.  By late 2025, Yemen’s GDP had shrunk by roughly half, inflation exceeded 35% in IRG areas, and public revenues had collapsed  .  Donor aid and remittances became the lifeline of both zones, but funding shortfalls and politicized distribution left millions impoverished.

The following report presents a chronological analysis (2015–2025) overlaid with strategic insights, and maps the evolving financial institutions, currency regimes, fiscal dynamics, and the roles of all major actors.  It also offers thematic deep dives into key issues: the currency “war” and dual banking system; hydrocarbons economics; aid flows; food/fuel inflation; institutional collapse and corruption; and emerging sectors (e.g. digital finance, microfinance).  Throughout, evidence-based citations are provided (see endnotes).  The tone is factual, multidisciplinary, and policy‑oriented.

1. Chronology of Economic and Financial Developments (2015–2025)
	•	2015 (War and Blockade): In March 2015 a Saudi‑led coalition intervened to restore President Hadi, reversing the Houthis’ seizure of Sana’a.  Civil conflict and a naval blockade instantly gutted Yemen’s economy.  Oil and gas production halted, imports ground to a standstill, and the Central Bank of Yemen (CBY) lost access to reserves  .  Public sector salaries and subsidies stopped; by late 2015 basic commodity prices had exploded (cumulative inflation spiking over 100%) and acute hunger spread.  International agencies warned of famine.  Insight: The loss of a unified central bank early on meant Yemen had no institution to stabilize prices or manage shortages . Instead, both sides began weaponizing the currency from the outset.
	•	2016 (Central Bank Split, Currency Crash): In September 2016 President Hadi ordered the CBY’s headquarters moved from Sana’a to Aden, formalizing a bifurcation of monetary control .  The Sana’a branch remained in the north (Houthi zones), and the Aden branch (internationally recognized) was left with few reserves or staff.  The rial immediately began tumbling.  By early 2017 the official peg of YR250/$ had broken, and in Aden one US$ cost ~YR370 on the black market  .  Humanitarian aid agencies, forced to use market rates, inadvertently fueled arbitrage (exchanging UN dollars at black‑market rates).  The CBY‑Aden began printing money against a Saudi deposit to pay salaries, but without foreign exchange to back it, this only accelerated inflation  .  Insight: The 2016 split of the CBY created two rival banks incapable of mutual stabilization .  Without coordination, the currency crash in government areas fueled famine and unrest (e.g. Aden protests in 2018), while the Houthis maintained a more stable rial by holding onto older notes and leveraging northwestern ports for forex.
	•	2017–2018 (Currency Arbitrage and Devaluation): Facing a surging parallel rate (YR800–1000/$ by 2018), the IRG floated the rial in August 2017 .  The Sana’a government refused to float its rates, keeping customs and tariffs at YR250/$ while Aden markets moved.  This currency arbitrage enriched money‑exchange operators and eroded humanitarian purchasing power.  International pressure (from the UN, World Bank and donors) finally convinced CBY‑Aden to abandon its peg  .  By late 2018, a Saudi $2 billion deposit had briefly staved off a crash: the rial recovered to ~YR340/$ after peaking near YR1750 .  But the funds were mostly exhausted by 2020.  Insight: This period saw the rial become a politicized commodity.  The World Bank and IMF began talking to Yemen, and donors experimented with “dual exchange rates” (offering a special rate for aid distribution).  Yet no stable framework emerged: rival authorities were locked in a game of one‑upmanship on currency policy  .
	•	2019–2020 (Formal Currency War and E-Rial): In Dec 2019 the Houthi authorities in Sana’a banned all new “Aden‑printed” banknotes, declaring them invalid in the north .  They also introduced a digital “e-Rial” (through select telecom-backed accounts) and later minted Houthi coins.  This cemented a two‑currency reality.  Consequently, Aden‑area rials plummeted into hyperinflation (trading ~YR642/$ by Jan 2020) while the old rial in Houthi areas remained around YR590/$  .  Citizens in the south hoarded ever‑new rials, driving food‐baskets costs up 400–700%.  Simultaneously, the IRG’s Aden bank struggled with corruption scandals (a UN panel alleged its officials misused Saudi deposits ) and dwindling reserves.  By early 2020 Yemen had effectively been partitioned financially.  Insight: The 2020 banknote ban was a turning point: it institutionalized the currency schism and foreshadowed Yemen’s permanent economic split  .  It also forced humanitarian actors to adapt (some began valuing aid at the market rather than “official” rate, after realizing fixed-rate vouchers were exploited for arbitrage).
	•	2020–2021 (Fiscal Collapse and Fragmentation): The IRG, now under a new Presidential Leadership Council (PLC) from 2022, effectively ran out of revenue.  Oil and gas revenues had been halted by conflict (and later by Houthi attacks).  Customs and tax collection fractured: in 2020 the Houthis seized the central port of Hudaydah (and taxed imports there), even as the south’s government lost customs revenue to competing southern ports.  Public budgets collapsed (no full national budget has been passed since 2019 ), and the government depended on irregular Saudi/UAE grants ($1–2 billion/year in sporadic tranches ).  Unpaid salaries spurred protests in Aden and Mukalla.  In Apr 2022 the Houthis scaled up economic warfare: they blockaded the IRG’s oil export terminals with drones/missiles .  A short UN truce (Apr–Oct 2022) included talk of reopening roads and paying wages, but collapsed.  The Houthis then resumed their naval campaign (attacking Red Sea shipping) and tightened the economic vice: they banned government‑issued fuel, imposed customs fees on overland trade, and plowed checkpoints on trade routes  .  Insight: By 2022 the conflict had “migrated to the economy” – controlling customs, ports and oil fields became as important as holding cities  .  The IRG was starved of forex, becoming an oil importer, while Houthis amassed war revenues from the north.
	•	2023 (Banking Struggle and Resurgent Rial): In 2023–2024 the Aden‑based CBY took bold steps to reclaim control.  It consolidated money transfer networks under a Unified Money Transfer Network (UNMoney) from early 2024  , and in July revoked the licenses of six major Sana’a-headquartered banks (including commercial and microfinance banks) that had not relocated to Aden .  This aimed to force all banking via Aden and international lines.  The Houthis retaliated by closing branches and blocking transfers.  In response to rampant speculation, in mid‑2024 the PLC government instituted new exchange controls and an import‑financing committee.  By late 2024, with renewed Saudi grants and tightened FX controls, the rial in government areas had appreciated by ~40%, easing inflation .  (The IMF noted that inflation peaked at ~35% in mid‑2025 as the rial weakened, then subsided after August reforms .)  Houthi areas, in contrast, continued to use old rials at a roughly fixed official parity.
	•	2025 (Stabilization and Stalemate): In 2025 the currency tug‑of‑war remained intense.  The PLC’s reforms – relocating banks to Aden, centralizing FX trading, and inviting new Saudis deposits – finally stabilized the southern rial (trading ~YR1,600–1,800/$ by Nov 2025  ).  South Yemen cut fuel subsidies (further realigning prices with market rates) and announced a $1.2 billion Saudi aid package in Aug 2023 (part disbursed 2024–25).  These moves cut food‑basket inflation roughly in half in government areas by mid‑2025.  However, in Houthi regions prices fell little (the old rial’s value was still fixed).  Meanwhile, Yemen’s war economy shifted again: in Sept 2025 amid regional rapprochements the U.S. halted Houthi sanctions, forcing some cooperation talks.  But as of Nov 2025 Yemen remains divided: the Houthis control Sana’a and much of the northwest, the IRG controls Aden/Marib and the oil/gas fields, and neither side can project power enough to end the stalemate.

The timeline above is a high‑level sketch.  Figure 1 (below) and Table 1 (right) summarize this chronologically and by actors (see pages at end).  Key inflection points include: the CBY split (Sept 2016), the Houthi currency ban (Dec 2019), the blockade of oil (2022), and the UN‑brokered currency escalations (2024–25).  Each of these events entwined conflict dynamics with economic policy in novel ways.

2. Actors and Stakeholders

Yemen’s economic reality reflects a tapestry of domestic and international actors, each pursuing strategic interests through financial means.  Below are the principal players and their roles (these underlie Figure 2 actor-event map).
	•	Internationally Recognized Government (IRG) / Presidential Leadership Council (PLC) – Based in Aden (until 2022 under President Hadi, now an 8‑member PLC backed by Saudi/UAE).  Seeks to maintain legitimacy over “southern” Yemen.  Controls the Aden‑based CBY which, despite lacking reserves, issues the rial and runs fiscal policy (often printing money to pay salaries).  Heavily dependent on Saudi/UAE grants ($1–2 b/year) to cover budgets  .  It lost control of northern economic hubs and had to cede many institutions; now focuses on stabilizing the currency and finance via external support.  Its economic strategy (under the PLC) has included forming national committees for imports and FX, encouraging bank relocations to Aden, and attempting to reactivate oil exports (through UAE-mediated deals).  Internal divisions (e.g. between traditional Islah-affiliated units vs. secessionist STC groups) have weakened cohesion.  Cited: IMF, Sana’a Center, Sana’a.
	•	Ansar Allah (Houthis) and Sana’a Central Bank – Zaidi Shia militia turned de facto government in Sanaa (allied with ex-Saleh GPC elements).  They control the northwestern highlands and institutions.  The Houthi-controlled CBY in Sana’a declared Aden notes invalid (Dec 2019) and later issued its own digital (e‑Rial) and coin currency .  It floats little cash, preferring barter and existing rials, which kept official inflation “stable” but created chronic liquidity shortages.  The Houthis have taxed imports at Hudaydah/Salif, siphoned oil/gas revenues (from Ma’rib/Shabwah pipelines), and targeted IRG oil terminals (2022–2023)  .  They also leveraged port revenues (Hodeidah taxes, telecom monopolies) to fund governance and military spending.  Economically, they have run parallel budgets and used Gulf aid selectively (some UN food aid resumed by July 2024 after blockade).  Cited: Reuters, Sana’a Center, IMF.
	•	Saudi Arabia – Leads the 2015 coalition backing the IRG.  Seeks a weak friendly Yemen, blocking Iranian influence.  Saudi Arabia has provided the bulk of foreign aid to the government (billions in grants and oil deposits) and pressured the PLC on reforms.  It initially insisted on fiscal orthodoxy (e.g. via a “Roadmap” agreement), at times curbing CBY‑Aden’s currency interventions.  Saudi penalties (e.g. freezing oil revenues at Mukalla’s pipeline, which instead went to a Saudi bank) have been used to discipline finance.  Riyadh also mediated intra-IRG conflicts, funded military operations, and engaged in oil diplomacy (such as the Arab Monetary Fund support).  In 2023–2025 Saudi influence led to partial de‑escalations: e.g. UN envoy Grundberg’s July 2024 agreement (urging bilateral pause on banking hostilities) was driven by Riyadh .  Saudi Belt projects (roads, security) and clandestine cash infusions have kept IRG afloat.  Cited: Reuters, Sana’a Center, IMF.
	•	United Arab Emirates (UAE) – Coalition partner, but increasingly a separate power center.  Backed the Southern Transitional Council (STC) and local militias (Giants Brigades, Hadrami, Abyan forces) aiming to carve out a southern state.  Officially withdrew ground forces by 2019, but militarily and economically entrenched in Socotra Island and parts of Abyan/Shabwah.  UAE-linked firms (e.g. ADNOC) control Socotra’s fuel market, sparking protests over exorbitant prices  .  The UAE has also paid salaries and pensions in liberated areas, invested in ports (Aden, Mokha), and facilitated export deals (e.g. for IRG oil via third countries).  In practice, Abu Dhabi’s role has been double-edged: it has sustained southern governance (and splintered Hadi’s authority), but also earned distrust by economic domination of southern provinces.  Cited: Yemen Press Agency, Al-Thawra, Sana’a Center.
	•	Southern Transitional Council (STC) – A UAE‑backed secessionist body led by Aiderous al-Zubaidi.  Controls Aden (2019 coup) and other southern provinces with its own militias.  While formally aligned with the IRG in coalition battles, the STC often undermines Aden’s authority and collects taxes locally.  It maintains parallel security forces and has even negotiated separate fuel imports for Socotra under UAE auspices.  The STC’s economic agenda is essentially separatist autonomy: it seeks a share of oil revenues (e.g. insisting on local control of Hadramawt’s exports) and UAE support for southern salaries.  Cited: [Contextual from report of Riyadh Agreement, Sana’a Center notes]*.
	•	Iran – Regional patron of the Houthis.  Although not a direct financial backer at scale, Iran is believed to provide limited military aid and strategic guidance.  Iranian influence is widely cited in the conflict narrative (and the Saudis/Riyadh peace envoy have engaged Tehran indirectly).  However, its economic role is minor compared to Gulf money.  It serves more as a geopolitical factor, prompting U.S./Saudi caution (e.g. the earlier Houthi FTO designation, later lifted in 2021) than as a source of Yemeni liquidity.  Cited: ACLED, media (Houthis linked to Iran support).
	•	IMF, World Bank, UN Agencies and Donors (US, EU, Gulf, INGOs) – These international players have injected thousands of millions into Yemen since 2015 (humanitarian + limited development aid).  The IMF allocated SDR $665m in Aug 2021 (COVID response), which could yield ~$665m hard currency .  World Bank and Arab Funds also gave grants (e.g. a $400m cash-for-work loan, Arab Monetary Fund aid).  Donors have largely channeled funds through NGOs and the CBY‑Aden.  They insisted on reform (pressuring the rial to float in 2017 ) and on accountability (World Bank funded new electronic wage systems).  However, uneven access (northern NGOs kept to fixed-rates) meant some funds fueled arbitrage.  Aid agencies like the WFP warned repeatedly of cuts due to underfunding.  In 2023 the WFP reduced rations after a $1.66 b funding gap.  Donors remain crucial (e.g. pledges of billions at UN conferences in 2024–25), but also instrumentalize aid: funds often target specific governorates or political constituencies.  Cited: Sana’a Center, IMF, WFP statements.
	•	Central Bank of Yemen (Aden branch) – Legally the national central bank, recognized by the IMF/Gulf community.  Managed by government appointees, its governor (since 2021) was tasked with unifying monetary policy.  CBY‑Aden controlled currency issuance (new rials since 2016), foreign reserves (Saudi deposit of $2b, IMF swaps, aid-funded forex), and attempted currency stabilization.  Weaknesses: a massive staff split (most archives/staff in Sana’a) and scant reserves.  It faced repeated accusations of favoritism (a UN panel alleged misuse of Riyadh’s deposit for selective importers ), which it denies.  Key actions: floating the rial (2017), auctioning FX for imports (2021), establishing UNMoney network (2024), and from Aug 2025 raising reserves and sterilizing money supply (with Saudi-funded FX sales)  .  Cited: Sana’a Center analysis, IMF.
	•	Central Bank of Yemen (Sana’a branch) – Houthi-controlled.  It prints older-series rials (as of 2016) and sets some internal tariffs.  It has no foreign reserves (all reserves were moved to Aden) and is not IMF‑recognized.  In practice it mainly clears government transactions and has experimented with digital credits (e-Rial).  Its foreign policy (e.g. routing humanitarian dollars via Iran or third-country banks) is constrained.  A major move was the 2024 proposal to denominate some transfers in Saudi riyals  to preserve liquidity.  But the Sana’a CBY cannot control exchange rates in Aden or foreign trade.  Cited: Sana’a Center reports.
	•	Commercial Banks, Exchange Houses and Hawala Networks – The money changers have been major actors: during the 2017–2021 collapse they profited from dual rates, often operating across zones.  Several large banks (Tadhamon, Kuraimi, Shamil Bank, etc.) had branches in both north and south.  The IRS of 2024 shows how enmeshment with political factions allowed illicit speculation.  For example, in mid-2021 the CBY-Aden closed 50 exchangers and inspected banks to curb speculation .  Sanctions (e.g. on Houthi financial backers) and Aden’s threats (2024 bank license revocations ) forced many banks to shift operations south.  Microfinance institutions (Al-Amal, Al-Kuraimi) also got drawn in, highlighting how even “innovative” sectors were caught in the conflict.  Cited: Sana’a Center (July–Sept 2024), Sana’a Center (July 2021).
	•	Tribal and Local Power Brokers – In Yemen’s periphery, tribal sheikhs and local militias control many roads and trade.  In petroleum areas (Marib, Shabwah, Hadramawt) tribes have historically blown pipelines to demand local revenue shares .  During the war they have been armed clients of either side (often shifting allegiances).  Tribes also operate informal smuggling networks (fuel, qat, weapons) that move goods bypassing customs, undermining both sides’ revenues.  While hard to map, these networks are essential for remittances to reach rural families.  Tribal taxation (e.g. on migrants or fuel convoys) provides an unofficial revenue stream for some local authorities.  Cited: ACW analysis, news (e.g. pipeline bombings).
	•	Other Foreign Actors – The US, UK and EU have mostly provided targeted aid and sanctions.  The US’s 2021 reversal of the Houthi FTO label (and its 2022 designation of them as terror-supporting) directly affected banks: Houthi-area banks moved some functions to Aden to avoid US sanctions .  Oman has quietly facilitated negotiations and allowed limited flights.  Gulf rivals (Qatar, Kuwait) engaged through UN diplomacy.  The “Arab Coalition” countries (Saudi/UAE) have been the dominant regional players.  Cited: ACLED, Sana’a Center.

This complex cast turns Yemen’s economy into a matrix of competition.  Figure 2 (below) sketches how each actor intersects with events – for example, the Houthis weaponize customs, while Saudi/the IRG lean on fuel subsidies and bank enforcement; donors and the UN shuttle between facilitating aid and demanding monetary discipline; UAE-enabled businesses dominate southern fuel markets, etc.

3. The Currency “War” and Dual Banking System

Yemen’s currency saga is at the heart of its economic crisis.  As noted, two central banks and two rials have functioned since 2016  .  The Government of Yemen (CBY‑Aden) has printed “new rials” (2017–2025 series) to finance budgets, abandoning fixed pegs and eventually floating the currency.  The Sana’a authorities continue to circulate only pre‑2016 banknotes (and some newly minted coins) and have maintained a separate rate policy.  These overlapping regimes have driven persistent inflation disparities: by mid-2025, the Aden rial was ~YR1,630/US$1  (a stabilization from YR2,600+ earlier), whereas the Houthi‑area currency remained pegged (officially ~YR600 before 2022, though black‐market implied rates exceeded YR1,200).  In effect, two parallel exchange rates prevail – one for government-held markets and a pseudo-fixed rate in the north.

This “currency war” has several consequences.  Arbitrage thrives: money‑changers buy cheap notes in Houthi areas (by unofficial means) and sell in the government zones.  During crises, Yemeni exporters (or aid agencies) have shopped for the highest-dollar bids, draining reserves.  Inflation has been especially brutal in the Aden sphere.  For example, in late 2021 the rial collapsed to YR2,900/$ (its worst value since 2016) amid massive speculative attacks .  CBY‑Aden’s 2021 intervention (raiding exchange shops) and a shift of some USD remittances into formal banks helped it recover by year-end  .  Similarly, in Aug 2025 a new policy council (with the PLG) devalued the rial and used Saudi deposits to rebuild reserves , which slashed food inflation in Aden by ~50%.

In contrast, the Houthi-controlled zones saw limited formal inflation (state‐fixed prices) but rampant black‑market hikes.  The Houthis’ decision to reject new rials (Jan 2020) was justified as anti‑inflationary, yet it isolated their liquidity.  When CBY‑Aden floated its currency, north-south trade suffered: households in Sana’a had only old, tattered notes and paid a premium to buy Aden’s new bills .  By Jan 2020 official exchange data showed divergent rates (YR655 in Aden vs YR590 in Sana’a) .  Everyday Yemenis in Houthi areas began hoarding dollars and Saudi riyals, fearing a general crash.

Attempts at monetary innovation have largely failed.  The Sana’a CBY’s e‑Rial pilots (2018–2019) and April 2020 food-voucher programs collapsed due to Yemen’s cash-based economy: only ~6% of adults have bank accounts .  Similarly, CBY‑Aden’s 2024 Unified Money Network (UNMoney) sought to centralize e-payments, but the Sana’a authorities threatened banks that use it .  Ultimately, neither side has achieved currency unity.  As an IMF review notes, after years of printing, the IRG’s money supply far outstripped credible revenues, leaving real riyal purchasing power at historic lows .  Only a political settlement could truly reunify Yemen’s currency – an outcome still distant.

4. Oil and Hydrocarbon Economics

Oil and gas were Yemen’s pre-eminent revenue source (about 70–80% of GDP and exports ), concentrated in Hadramawt, Marib and Shabwah.  Before 2015, Yemen exported ~120,000 barrels/day of crude (primarily from Masila/Marib fields) and LNG via a pipeline to Aden.  Since war erupted, hydrocarbon output collapsed.  Key export terminals fell to the Houthis (Hudaydah) or were blockaded; pipelines were repeatedly bombed by insurgent tribes and rebels .  By late 2015 Yemen was functionally an importer of oil.  A brief revival occurred when the IRG reopened Marib’s gas fields in 2018, but Houthi offensives shut them again.

From 2022 onward, oil became a direct weapon.  After the IRG retook Marib’s Safer field in 2020, the Houthis launched drone/missile attacks on the export terminal at Belhaf and other tankers .  The net effect: oil exports were halted.  The IMF notes that “after the Houthis’ attacks on oil facilities halted oil exports in 2022, Yemen became an oil importer” .  The complete loss of hydrocarbon revenue forced the IRG to adopt harsh fiscal and import controls and lean entirely on grants.

The blockade’s damage is massive: Hadramawt and Shabwah are under IRG control, and Marib (gas) is IRG-held, yet the Euphrates Oil Company (Tawke field) and pipelines could not be rehabilitated amid insecurity.  Protests in IRG areas (e.g. Mukalla mid-2025) have focused on blackouts and fuel shortages .  The IRG’s internal quarrels and lack of maintenance led to repeated fuel tanker scarcities.  Insight: Control of oil fields and export routes has become as strategic as any frontline.  The Houthis’ successful embargo has kept the IRG weak; the IRG’s inability to export has often undermined it in diplomatic talks  .

At the same time, local economic grievances surfaced.  Southern militias (UAE-aligned or STC) have fought over pipeline revenue.  Tribal blockades (e.g. by Sabban tribe in Marib) intermittently shut fields to extract concessions.  Informal exports (smuggled overland or via neighboring ports) fill some gaps but undermine tax bases.

In sum, Yemen’s oil economy remains a militarized resource.  Without secure exports or a unified fiscal management, neither side can fully exploit these assets.  Analysts emphasize that for any real stabilization, hydrocarbon revenues must resume in a transparent and equitable fashion  .

5. International Aid and Its Manipulation

Humanitarian and development aid have been both lifelines and geostrategic tools.  Aid flows ballooned after 2015 — peaking at over $10 billion/year for relief — but never matched needs.  The UN’s Yemen Response Plan remains chronically underfunded (less than 50% in 2024).  Major donors include the US, EU, UN agencies, GCC, and the World Bank.  Some aid (food rations, cash-for-work) is calibrated to stabilize food prices and incomes; other flows (development loans) aim to shore up governance.

However, currency policies greatly affected aid efficacy.  Early on, aid agencies paid beneficiaries in local currency at the “official” rate (YR250/$), which by 2016 grossly overvalued aid.  This inadvertently created arbitrage: smugglers would convert these funds on the black market.  It was only after CBY‑Aden floated the rial in 2017 that agencies like UNICEF and UNDP agreed to exchange a World Bank grant at market rates , reducing unintended enrichment.  By contrast, the Houthis insisted on official rates in the north, so northern beneficiaries saw little real gains even as inflation surged elsewhere.

The IMF and international financial institutions have also played a role.  Yemen rejoined IMF programs in 2021 with an SDR allocation (~$665m) , but deploying these funds faced governance hurdles.  A 2021 Sana’a Center analysis urged transparent SDR management (via an emergency monetary committee) .  The IMF’s Oct 2025 mission credits such steps: in mid-2025 the IRG created a National Committee for Regulating Imports, tightened import approvals, and restricted FX usage — measures that helped stabilize the rial and cut inflation .

Donors have at times played politics.  Gulf grants have been channeled irregularly (e.g. to finance military allies); Western donors have insisted on anti-corruption vetting (stalling budget support).  Sanctions on Houthi financial actors have pushed some aid through Aden’s banks.  The World Bank’s $400m social fund and cash-transfer programs were partly floated via Aden exchange networks as currency crises raged.  The WFP repeatedly warned (in 2022–25) that aid cuts could push millions past the hunger threshold, given these monetary instabilities.

In summary, aid has been necessary but insufficient.  Both sides view it as zero-sum: the Houthis seek to capture international legitimacy by running parallel aid systems in the north, while the IRG leverages aid into political capital (e.g. UN pledges to restore salaries).  Aid has not resolved fiscal gaps — for example, even after Saudi injection of ~$1.2 b in Aug 2023, the IRG’s deficit remained acute  — but has temporarily filled critical needs.

6. Food, Fuel and Inflation Economics

Yemen imports ~90% of its food and fuel.  Thus currency swings and logistics bottlenecks translate directly into human suffering.  Early in the war, food baskets in Aden more than quadrupled in price (400–700% inflation) as the rial crashed .  By contrast, Houthi areas initially saw smaller official price rises (their fixed rate masked underlying shortage), though black-market prices soared.  Over the decade, Yemen’s inflation has been among the world’s highest.  As IMF notes, consumer inflation hit ~27% in 2024 and peaked above 35% by July 2025 .  Food aid deliveries and local subsidies have been essential to avert starvation, but funding gaps (e.g. a $1.66 b WFP shortfall in 2023) required cutting rations for millions.

Fuel is especially politicized.  From 2015–2020, fuel subsidies in IRG areas helped dampen shock.  When the government cut subsidies (2023–2025), diesel and petrol pump prices jumped accordingly.  In Aug 2025, public fuel prices in Aden fell ~22–28% month-on-month after subsidy adjustments (per humanitarian bulletins ).  In Houthi territory, fuel has remained cheaper (at official pre-war prices) but is scarce; many northern generators run on smuggled diesel from Saudi Arabia.  Socotra Island (UAE-controlled) saw the most egregious fuel crisis: as noted, a UAE-linked distributor raised gasoline prices dramatically, sparking protests  .  Socotrans allege that ADNOC and other firms impose a “monopoly” on petrol and gas, subjecting residents to “systematic starvation” via overpriced fuel  .  These supply shocks feed straight into inflation – a double‑digit CPI rate for food and energy is typical.  For example, mid-2025 currency stabilization in Aden cut the monthly cost of the minimum food basket by ~34% .

The interplay is vicious: a weaker rial means higher import bills, which in turn fuels budget deficits when oil is absent.  Households cope by reducing consumption (malnutrition rose), substituting qat for food, or borrowing.  In early 2025, anti‑inflation measures (currency reforms, Saudi fuel shipments) finally arrested the rial’s slide , but prices remain far above pre-war levels.

7. Institutional Collapse and Corruption Patterns

Widespread institutional breakdown has pervaded every sector.  Central ministries are duplicated or empty; tax collection is split.  Notably, the national budget essentially disappeared: since 2019 no comprehensive budget has been approved, meaning expenditures (salaries, projects) rely on emergency decrees and donor requests .  Both administrations frequently failed to pay civil servants on time, generating protests (e.g. 2022 Aden riots).  Water and electricity utilities have collapsed, partly due to unpaid maintenance and fuel shortages (the Sana’a power plant sometimes sees only ~6 hours of fuel).

Corruption has been endemic.  The same monetary fragmentation that spawned “currency wars” also created rent-seeking opportunities.  For instance, in 2021 a UN panel accused the CBY‑Aden of funnelling oil‑export deposits to favored importers via overpriced exchanges  (though this allegation was later walked back, it reflected deep mistrust).  Commercial traders and military contractors have exploited customs split: some cargoes avoid official channels entirely, while militia checkpoints extract unofficial levies.  Gulf states have complained of Houthi corruption in northern areas (e.g. ethnic/tribal favoritism in allocations), but the IRG is no paragon: tribal intermediaries close to senior leaders take lucrative contracts, and large donors’ funds have at times been diverted or matched with subsidies to business cronies (even ahead of the 2018 currency float, critics alleged some exchange shops were owned by security officials ).

Within institutions, nepotism has soared.  New governors or ministers often fill public positions with loyalists without exams.  Some UAE training programs in the south created rival “security services” that have bleeding‑edge payrolls.  In this vacuum, informal networks have taken over: hawala brokers manage most remittances (estimated at 10–20% of GDP), and these networks have come under scrutiny for laundering Houthi funds or evading sanctions.

On the flip side, a few reform efforts emerged.  The IRG in late 2025 mandated that all public sector earnings be in rials and ended most dollar allowances (addressing illegal parallel payment practices ).  They also formed committees to audit fuel imports and military purchases.  However, with no functioning court system and dueling legal frameworks, enforcement is spotty.  The net effect is a quasi-feudal system: if you are allied to an armed faction, you thrive; if not, you survive as a humanitarian dependency.

8. Emerging and New Sectors

Traditional industry has largely shut down, but a few nascent sectors have gained a foothold amid chaos:
	•	Digital Finance and Microfinance:  With physical cash scarce in some areas, some electronic payment platforms (the CBY‑Sana’a’s e-Rial mobile wallets, and CBY‑Aden’s UNMoney) have tried to expand.  Take-up is limited: Yemenis’ distrust of banks (just 6% banking penetration) stalled early e‑salary pilots .  However, several microfinance banks (e.g. Al Kuraimi, Al-Amal) and mobile money firms operate across lines, enabling some small entrepreneurs and women-headed households to get loans or transfer funds.  These institutions found themselves in the crossfire of political battles – e.g. in mid-2024 the Aden CBY revoked licenses of six banks, including microfinance ones, to coerce relocation .  In effect, micro-lending persists but only on a tiny scale relative to needs.
	•	Remittances and Informal Trade:  The largest “new sector” is the Yemeni diaspora economy.  Remittances from Gulf-workers and others (10–20% of GDP pre-war) continue to flow via informal hawala networks.  These flows have largely stabilized consumption: often remittance receivers pay for imports themselves in dollars.  Additionally, a small class of Yemenis engages in entrepreneurial trade – exporting qat (a mild stimulant) to Somalia, or importing charcoal/fish.  Covid-19 and conflict curtailed but did not eliminate cross-border commerce.  Such informal commerce evades tariffs, so it’s hard to tax, but it underpins basic livelihoods.
	•	New Businesses:  A few local tech startups and mobile services have emerged (for instance, YemenMall in Aden sells goods online, Yemeni mobile apps collect donations), but in an environment of low trust and high insecurity, capital investment is scarce.  Utilities have seen attempts at PPPs (southern ports and power plants), but results are mixed.

Overall, the “new economy” in Yemen is muted.  Without rule of law or large-scale capital, innovation is ad hoc.  Some UN and NGO-run cash-for-work and short-term training programs provide microcredit support in camps, but these are band-aids.  The one bright spot is mobile connectivity: nearly all Yemenis have cell phones, and even the warlord zones (Houthi north, southern coalitions) allow phone networks.  Fintech experiments (mobile wallets, bio-ID cash transfers) have been piloted with mixed success.  These may lay a foundation for a more integrated financial infrastructure post-conflict.

Table 1. Actor-Event Matrix (illustrative):

Actor/Entity	Role/Influence	Key Economic Actions/Events
IRG / PLC & CBY-Aden	Southern government; retains IMF-recognition and donor backing.	Budget deficits; floated rial; formed import‑finance committee (2024); partly stabilized currency (2025) . Dependent on Saudi/UAE grants .
Ansar Allah (Houthis) / CBY-Sana’a	Controls north; uses parallel institutions.	Banned new banknotes (2020) ; introduced e‑Rial; taxes northern imports; blocked south’s oil exports (2022) ; limited liquidity by paying salaries partly in kind.
Saudi Arabia	Coalition leader, major financier of IRG.	Deployed military coalition; deposited $2b at CBY‑Aden (2018); brokered Riyadh Agreement (2019); provided ~$2b aid (2023–24) ; pressured IRG on reforms.
United Arab Emirates	Coalition partner, IRG donor, supporter of southern separatists.	Backed STC militias; secured Socotra (fuel imports); imposed high fuel prices via ADNOC (sparking protests)  ; built local security forces; partly funded IRG areas.
Southern Transitional Council	UAE-backed secessionist body in south.	Seized Aden (2019); co‑manages southern provinces; collects local revenue; occasionally clashes with IRG; lobbies for southern oil revenue share.
Iran	Political backer of Houthis.	Provides limited material support and strategy to Houthis; influence triggers US/Saudi caution (e.g. Houthi FTO label in 2021); but little direct economic aid.
IMF/World Bank/UN agencies	Providers of financial aid and policy advice.	IMF: SDR allocation (2021) ; advised on FX stabilization (NCRFI, 2025) . WB: ~$400m cash-for-work programs. WFP: forced to cut rations due to funding gaps.
Commercial Banks & Money Exchangers	Key intermediaries; some HQ in Sana’a, some in Aden.	Engaged in rate arbitrage (2017–2021) ; CBY-Aden shut many (2024) . Earned huge profits (one bank ~$80m in 2017). HQ relocations after U.S. sanctions (2021).
Tribal Networks (Marib, Shabwah)	Local power brokers in oil areas.	Periodically sabotage pipelines/oilfields to demand payments ; control smuggling routes; levy informal taxes on traders.
Humanitarian NGOs / INGOs	Deliver aid; use cash transfers.	Distribute food/CFW grants; pressured to use realistic FX rates. Suffer from inflation (aid buys less). Sometimes caught in politicized divisions (north/south programming).

(This matrix is schematic; many other actors – e.g. AQAP in south, tribal elders – play minor economic roles.)

10. Conclusion: Enduring Fragility

A decade of conflict has fundamentally reshaped Yemen’s political economy.  No single actor holds decisive economic power: the Houthis dominate revenue ports in the northwest, the IRG manages Gulf funds and western recognition, and Gulf donors pull all strings.  Despite periodic reforms and international interventions, Yemen’s financial system remains on life support.  Currency stabilization in 2024–25, underpinned by Saudi support and CBY reforms, offers a small reprieve; yet a full recovery is impossible without political settlement.  In the meantime, Yemenis face continuing hardship: inflation, unemployment, and aid dependency have surged.

This analysis underscores that Yemen’s war is as much over banks and gas fields as it is over territory.  Any lasting solution must address the deep economic fragmentation: reunifying the central bank, reintegrating oil revenues, and building transparent fiscal institutions.  Policymakers should note that unilateral economic measures (blockades, money printing, bans) have so far backfired, deepening mistrust and fragility.  As the IMF report (Oct 2025) advises, sustainable recovery will require “strictly limited monetary financing, transparent budgeting, and revitalized export sectors”  .  The path forward is narrow: a deescalation of economic warfare coupled with targeted international support (grants for critical imports, incentives for confidence-building measures) is needed to prevent further collapse.
